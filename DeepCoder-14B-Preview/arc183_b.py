    # However, since each step can be any of the M elements, the transition is the sum over all possible elements
    
    # So, the transition for one step is the sum of all possible elements' contributions
    
    # We'll represent the transition as a function that, given a state, returns the new states and their contributions
    
    # To compute the sum for N steps, we'll use binary exponentiation:
    # sum = 0
