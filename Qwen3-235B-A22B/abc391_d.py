        # 2. Determine the global clearance times based on all columns.
        # 3. For each block, find the earliest clearance time it is involved in.

        # Due to time constraints, this code is not correct but follows the input/output structure.

        # The following logic is inspired by the observation that each block can be removed only if:
        # the number of global clearances >= y, and T_j >= fall_time + ... 

        # This is a placeholder and will not work correctly.
