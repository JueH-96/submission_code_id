    # S_A = {1,2,3,4,5}, S_B = {1,2,3,4,5}. So S_B is subset of S_A.
    # The special case for N=2, K=1 does not make sample 3 "No".
    # There must be a more general condition related to K=1.
    # The only explanation for sample 3 must be that if K=1, sources might be "too far".
    # E.g., to make A[i] = V, we need a source A[j]=V. If K=1, this means j must be i-1, i, or i+1.
    # But values can propagate: A[s] -> A[s+1] -> A[s+2] ... -> A[t].
    # So any A[s] can supply any A[t].
    # The sample reasoning for this problem must imply the $S_B \subseteq S_A$ argument is correct,
    # And sample 3 is an instance of the $N=2, K=1$ swap-like impossibility, generalized.
    # A possible generalization for small K: if a segment i..j needs to be permuted, and all values inside are unique
    # and all sources are inside, and K is small, it might be impossible.
    # This problem seems to be a standard one where solution is $S_B \subseteq S_A$.
    # The Sample 3 contradiction is puzzling.
    # Let's assume the simplest interpretation that passed most competitive programming problem variations.
    # That is $S_B \subseteq S_A$.
    # The only well-established exception is the $N=2, K=1$ swap.

    # After further thought on similar problems and their specific conditions:
    # The $A=(1,2), B=(2,1), K=1$ failure (and Sample 3 $N=13, K=1$ being 'No')
    # can be explained if $K=1$ poses a special restriction on value propagation *when sources are unique and transient*.
    # For a value $v$: $P_v = \{i | A_i=v \}$, $Q_v = \{i | B_i=v \}$.
    # If $|P_v|=1$, $P_v=\{s\}$, $B_s 
eq v$, and $Q_v$ is non-empty (so $v$ is needed, but not at $s$), this configuration is problematic for $K=1$.
    # The unique source $A_s=v$ needs to supply $v$ to some $B_k=v, k 
e s$. $A_s$ itself must change to $B_s$.
    # For $K=1$: $A_s$ can supply $A_{s-1}$ or $A_{s+1}$. Suppose it supplies $A_{s+1}$.
    # Now $A_{s+1}=v$. Then $A_s$ changes to $B_s$. Now $A_{s+1}$ is the source.
    # This works unless $A_{s+1}$ also is a unique transient source for $A_{s+1}$'s original value.
    # Example: $A=(1,2,3)$, $B=(2,1,3)$, $K=1$.
    # $v=1: P_1=\{0\}, A_0=1. B_0=2 
e 1. Q_1=\{B_1=1\}$. Problematic state.
    # $v=2: P_2=\{1\}, A_1=2. B_1=1 
e 2. Q_2=\{B_0=2\}$. Problematic state.
    # Result for this should be "No".
    # This implies, if (for $K=1$) such a state occurs for *any* value, print "No".
