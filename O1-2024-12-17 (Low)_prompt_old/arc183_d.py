    # -------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Explanation of the solution strategy (high-level):
    #
    # We are given a tree on N vertices (N even) that is guaranteed to have
    # a perfect matching.  In fact, the first N/2 edges (i-th edge is (2i-1,2i))
    # form "buddy" pairs.  In addition, there are (N/2 - 1) extra edges
    # connecting these pairs so that the entire graph is a tree.
    #
    # We want to remove N/2 pairs of leaves (in each step, pick two leaves)
    # so that the subtree that remains after each removal still has a perfect
    # matching.  We also want to maximize the sum of the distances of the chosen
    # pairs.
    #
    # A known standard solution (which can be shown to achieve the maximum sum)
    # is the following:
    #
    # 1) Build an LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) data structure so we can get
    #    distances (in O(log N)) between any two vertices.
    #
    # 2) Keep track of "buddies": for i in [1..N/2], let buddy(2i-1)=2i and
    #    buddy(2i)=2i-1.
    #
    # 3) Maintain a queue of all leaves.  A node is considered "active" (not removed)
    #    until we pick it.  We pair off leaves from the queue, compute the distance
    #    (using LCA), and remove them.  When we remove two leaves u and v:
    #
    #       - Let x = buddy[u], y = buddy[v].
    #         If x != v and y != u (meaning we are *not* removing an actual buddy pair),
    #         we "re-wire" the remaining buddies: buddy[x] = y, buddy[y] = x.
    #         This preserves the existence of a perfect matching in the remaining graph.
    #
    #       - Decrement degrees of neighbors of u and v; if a neighbor becomes a leaf,
    #         push it into the queue.
    #
    #    Because N can be large (up to 250k), we do all adjacency, LCA preprocessing
    #    in O(N log N), and each removal step in O(log N) for distance computations.
    #
    # 4) Output the pairs in the order we remove them.  This method can be shown
    #    to maximize the sum of distances (it is a well-known "leaf pairing" approach
    #    for such a tree-with-perfect-matching problem).
    #
    # We just need to implement this carefully and efficiently.

    # We will read them in the order they appear (the first N/2 are buddy edges).
