    # 1) The leftmost (non-dot) character in row i is R[i].
    # 2) The topmost (non-dot) character in column j is C[j].
    #
    # We will use backtracking over rows:
    # - For each row i, we choose exactly 3 distinct columns to place A,B,C.
    # - Among those chosen columns, the letter R[i] must go into the leftmost column index.
    # - The other two letters go into the other two chosen columns in either permutation.
    # - While we place letters in column j, if it's the first (topmost) letter in col j,
    #   then it must match C[j]. If we already placed a letter in a higher row in col j,
    #   then there's no additional restriction from topmost.
    # - We also track that each column can only have one of each letter (to ensure exactly
    #   one A, one B, one C in each column).
    # - If we manage to fill all rows, we then verify each column indeed has A,B,C exactly once.
