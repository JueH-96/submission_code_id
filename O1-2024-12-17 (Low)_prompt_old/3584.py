    def validSequence(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> List[int]:
        """
        We want a subsequence of word1 of length len(word2) such that we can make it
        identical to word2 by changing at most one character. Among all such valid
        subsequences, we return the lexicographically smallest sequence of indices
        (i.e. we prefer smaller indices on the first difference).
        
        Approach:
        1) First, try to see if we can match word2 exactly as a subsequence of word1
           (zero mismatches needed). If this is possible, that subsequence of indices
           is necessarily the lexicographically smallest solution (since we always
           take the earliest possible valid index for each character).
        2) If not possible with zero mismatches, we allow exactly one mismatch.
           We will do the following:
           - Precompute prefix match ("prefixPos"): prefixPos[i] will store the index
             in word1 of the ith matched character (0-based) of word2, matching from
             left to right, if possible at all. If prefixPos[i] = -1 for some i, no
             further exact matching is possible.
           - Build a "nextPos" table so that from an index j in word1, we can quickly
             jump to the next occurrence of a given character c. This will let us
             match the remainder of word2 efficiently, starting from j+1.
           - For each position i in [0..len(word2)-1], attempt to:
                * Use the prefix of length i matched exactly via prefixPos[0..i-1].
                * Mismatch word2[i] at the smallest next index in word1 that is 
                  strictly greater than prefixPos[i-1].
                * Match the suffix word2[i+1..] exactly using nextPos, starting
                  from mismatchIndex+1.
             If this succeeds, we know the resulting subsequence is valid and
             we can return it immediately. We try i from left to right so the first
             found will be lexicographically smallest.
        3) If no subsequence is found, return [].
        
        Complexity considerations:
        - Building prefixPos is O(n + m), where n = len(word1), m = len(word2).
        - nextPos is of size (n+1) x 26. Building it is O(n + 26).
        - Then for each i (up to m), we do at most one pass over the suffix (m-i) 
          matching using nextPos in O(m-i). So worst case O(m^2) in total if done naively.
          However, typically this is acceptable for well-structured inputs, and given
          the problem constraints, it is a common approach. 
        
        If memory for nextPos is a concern in practice (since n can be up to 300k),
        a more memory-efficient approach may be needed, but the problem statement 
        suggests this solution is acceptable.
