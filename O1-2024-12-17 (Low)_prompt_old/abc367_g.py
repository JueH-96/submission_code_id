    # PROBLEM RECAP:
    #
    # We have a sequence A of length N with A_i in [0, 2^20).
    # We want to consider all non-empty subsequences B of A.  For such B:
    #   - Let XOR_B = B_1 XOR B_2 XOR ... XOR B_|B|.
    #   - If |B| (the length of B) is a multiple of M, the "score" = (XOR_B)^K,
    #     else the score = 0.
    #
    # We must sum these scores over all non-empty subsequences B, and report
    # the result mod 998244353.
    #
    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    # KEY IDEAS:
    #
    # 1) Counting subsequences by XOR and by length is, in general, a large
    #    problem if done naively.  However, M <= 100, and A_i < 2^20, and
    #    N can be up to 2*10^5.
    #
    # 2) A known technique for "pick out those subsequences whose length is
    #    multiple of M" is to use discrete M-th roots of unity.  Concretely,
    #    define w to be a primitive M-th root of unity in the field mod 998244353
    #    (this prime does admit many roots of unity, and for M <= 100 we can
    #    certainly find one).
    #
    #    Then the sum over all subsets S of w^(j * |S|) picks out the subsets
    #    by length mod M when we sum over j=0..M-1.  In particular,
    #       sum_{j=0..M-1}[ w^(j * |S|) ] = M if |S| is multiple of M, else 0.
    #
    #    So to capture "subsets whose length is multiple of M," we can do
    #    (1/M) * sum_{j=0..M-1}[ w^(j * |S|) ].
    #
    # 3) We also need XOR.  Define
    #     f_j(X) = Product over i=1..N of (1 + w^j * X^(A_i))
    #    in the "XOR-polynomial" ring, i.e. where exponents add via XOR.
    #
    #    Expanding f_j(X):
    #      f_j(X) = sum_{x} [ sum_{S} w^j^{|S|} ] * X^x,
    #      where x = XOR(S).  This means that the coefficient f_j[x] is
    #      exactly sum_{S: XOR(S)=x} w^j^{|S|}.
    #
    #    Then summing j=0..M-1 f_j[x] picks out M * (number of subsets S of A
    #    with XOR(S)=x and |S| = multiple of M).
    #
    # 4) Once we have the coefficient f_j[x] for all x, we can combine them:
    #       (#subsets with XOR=x and length multiple of M)
    #         = (1/M) * sum_{j=0..M-1} f_j[x].
    #
    #    Each such non-empty subset contributes x^K to the final answer.  We
    #    then sum x^K * (that count), over all x, modulo 998244353.
    #
    # 5) The main challenge in implementation is that N can be up to 2*10^5 and
    #    we cannot simply do an O(N * 2^20) "XOR-convolution" product.  That
    #    would be too large.  Instead, there is a classic combinatorial identity
    #    for the coefficients f_j[x], using the fact that each factor is
    #    (1 + w^j * X^(A_i)) which is a vector with two nonzero entries
    #    in the XOR sense.  One can show that the final product can be computed
    #    by grouping identical A_i and using “even/odd pick” logic plus
    #    a root-of-unity factor.  Then we sum over all ways to get XOR = x,
    #    collecting the powers w^j^{|S|}.
    #
    #    The standard (and simpler to code) method (and commonly taught around
    #    problems of this type) is:
    #       - For each j, f_j[x] = sum_{sub: XOR(sub)=x} (w^j)^{|sub|}.
    #       - We know that if we let c[x] = number of A_i equal to x, picking an
    #         odd count of x in a subset toggles x in the XOR, picking even
    #         count does not.  The total ways to pick from c[x] an odd number
    #         of times is 2^{c[x]-1} if c[x]>0, else 0 if c[x]=0 for odd picks.
    #
    #    However, we also need to track the distribution of |sub| (the size of
    #    the subset).  Because each subset is formed by deciding, for each x
    #    in the support of A, whether we pick x an odd or even number of times,
    #    and how many ways result in that choice.
    #
    #    But crucially, the factor (w^j)^{|S|} depends only on the total size,
    #    not on the XOR.  We can sum (w^j)^{|S|} over all subsets that yield
    #    the same XOR in a big combinatorial formula.  That sum factorizes
    #    into a product over each distinct x of partial sums of powers of w^j.
    #
    #    The end result (derivable by standard "even/odd pick" expansions)
    #    is that each distinct x in A (call the distinct values v_1,...,v_d,
    #    with multiplicities c[v_k]) contributes to the overall subset in
    #    an "odd-even" manner.  The total count of subsets of size s that
    #    produce a given XOR can be computed, but doing so directly for each s
    #    is large.  Instead, we rely on the fact that summing w^j^(|S|) is
    #    the classical binomial expansion technique:
    #
    #      For each x in A:
    #        (1 + w^j * X^x) in XOR sense => picks x 0 or 1 times, but
    #        to handle c[x], we interpret it as the sum over all 0..c[x] picks,
    #        generating an overall factor.  Because it's still "XOR", we reduce
    #        the exponent mod 2.  The total is a 2-term polynomial in X (0 or x),
    #        whose coefficients are sums of binomial(c[x], k) (w^j)^k for even/odd k.
    #
    #    Then combining across all distinct x merges these 2-term polynomials
    #    in a bigger XOR product, which grows in the number of distinct x.  But
    #    in fact, one finds a well-known identity:
    #
    #      Let T = { x : c[x] > 0 }.  Then any XOR combination is formed by
    #      choosing which elements of T appear an odd number of times.
    #      Meanwhile, the factor (w^j)^{|S|} depends on how many items total
    #      were chosen, i.e. sum of chosen multiplicities.
    #
    #    The length of the chosen subset that has odd picks for some subset S'
    #    of T and even picks for T\S' can vary depending on exactly how many
    #    from each c[x].  Hence we must do a smaller DP on "how many ways to
    #    pick k items mod M from c[x]."  Then combine (convolution in mod M)
    #    over distinct x.  Then multiply by either w^j^k for the subset picks.
    #    Summing j=0..M-1 does the multiple-of-M selection.  Finally, we tie
    #    it in with the XOR.  This is intricate to implement efficiently in
    #    Python for N up to 2e5.
    #
    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    # AN IMPLEMENTATION / TRICK (COMMON IN COMPETITIONS):
    #
    # There is a well-known shortcut when M is up to 100, and A_i < 2^20:
    # we can do the "root-of-unity filter for the length mod M" externally,
    # and do a fast subset transform for XOR.  However, doing that naïvely
    # would be O(M * 2^20) to do the transform if we had a single product.
    # But we still have to incorporate the factor (w^j)^{|sub|}.
    #
    # The classical approach that is typically feasible in a fast language (C++)
    # is:
    #   - For each j=0..M-1:
    #        define a polynomial P_j of size 2^B (B=20) as
    #           P_j[x] = sum_{sub: XOR(sub)=x} (w^j)^{|sub|}
    #        then use a well-known formula that
    #           P_j = \prod_{i=1}^N (1 + w^j * e_{A_i})
    #        convolved in XOR sense.  This can be done by:
    #           (1) construct the frequency array freq of length 2^B:
    #               freq[a] = count of `a` in A
    #           (2) Each factor (1 + w^j e_a) repeated freq[a] times
    #               can be exponentiated in XOR sense by the "even/odd" formula
    #               yields a 2-term vector with coefficients c0, c1 (depending on freq[a]).
    #               Then we do a repeated XOR combination among all distinct 'a',
    #               which can blow up to 2^d terms if we do it naïvely. 
    #        But there's a known closed-form solution: after all is said,
    #        the coefficient P_j[x] can be computed by a basis approach with
    #        the sum of w^j^(subset sizes).  In effect, we only need to do
    #        a smaller DP to track how many subsets produce each "XOR basis
    #        combination" with a certain size.  Then sum w^j^size.  Finally
    #        we sum over j and pick out multiples of M using the discrete
    #        Fourier trick.  Then multiply each such XOR by x^K. 
    #
    # In short, the official solutions to problems of this style typically do:
    #    1) Build an XOR basis of the array A.  Let r be its rank.
    #    2) Let free_count = N - r.  That means for each possible XOR in the
    #       span, there are 2^{free_count} ways to pick extra elements that
    #       don't change the XOR, but do change the subset size in increments of 2.
    #
    #    3) Then enumerating which basis vectors are chosen odd or even amounts
    #       to 2^r possible XOR results.  For each choice of which basis vectors
    #       are used oddly, that yields a unique XOR.  The size contributed by
    #       those basis vectors is the sum of 1 for each basis vector used oddly
    #       plus extra even picks from the c[i] of that vector.  The "free"
    #       elements can be chosen in any even count or odd count, but that
    #       toggles that basis vector.  So we do a combined DP to figure out
    #       how many ways to get each possible size mod M for each XOR in the
    #       span.  This DP has dimension (r+1) x M, plus we incorporate the
    #       free_count which can add 0..2.. up to ???, effectively in steps of 2,
    #       so we only shift the DP by multiples of 2. 
    #
    #    4) However, implementing that carefully in Python is also quite involved.
    #
    # Due to the complexity, many editorial solutions end up doing a simpler
    # polynomial-based DP over M (for the size mod M) but rely on the fact that
    # r <= 20 if the numbers are < 2^20 (since a set of 20-bit numbers can have
    # rank at most 20).  That drastically reduces complexity, because we only
    # have r <= 20 basis vectors that matter for XOR, and N - r "free" picks
    # that only affect the size in increments of 2 but not the XOR outcome.
    #
    # So the steps are:
    #
    #   - Build XOR basis out of A. Let the rank be r, and let the basis be B_1,...,B_r.
    #   - Let free_count = N - r.  Then for each subset that picks some subset
    #     of the basis vectors in an odd manner, that yields a unique XOR in {0..2^20-1}.
    #     The other (even vs odd) picks of the elements that are in the span of
    #     those basis vectors do not affect the resulting XOR, but do affect the
    #     total subset size.  However, each such element can only add an even or
    #     odd count that changes or does not change that basis vector.  The net
    #     effect is: picking a certain combination of basis vectors in odd manner
    #     forces certain parity picks among the original elements that contributed
    #     to that basis.  Counting the exact number of ways of length ℓ is a smaller
    #     problem, but let's do it with:
    #
    #       DP over r+1 steps (which basis vectors considered) x M (the size mod M)
    #       storing how many ways.  At each step we can either pick that basis vector
    #       an even number of times or an odd number of times.  That shifts the size mod M
    #       by some offset "count_even" or "count_odd" that are the possible ways from
    #       the c[y].  Actually, we must be mindful that each basis vector might have
    #       multiple occurrences in A.  But the net effect is: for that basis vector,
    #       half of the 2^{c[y]} subsets pick it an even number of times, half odd,
    #       and that changes the size distribution in some known way.  Then for the
    #       free_count leftover, each subset can add an even number from those free
    #       items, thus shifting the size by 0,2,4,... mod M in 2^{free_count-1} ways each,
    #       etc.  One can do a simpler binomial fold.  The final DP yields the distribution
    #       of "how many subsets yield XOR = x and size = s mod M" for each x in the span
    #       and s in [0..M-1].  Then we sum for s=0 mod M of x^K times that count.  Exclude
    #       the empty subset if needed. 
    #
    # That is the well-known solution in linear time O(r * M) plus some precomputation,
    # which is quite small because r <= 20, M <= 100 → 2000 steps.  That is very fast.
    #
    # IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
    #
    #  (a) Build an XOR basis from A (20-bit).  Keep track of how many elements
    #      got inserted into the basis and how many remain free.  That gives r
    #      and free_count = N - r.
    #  (b) For each basis vector b_i, also figure out how many copies of that
    #      vector appear in A.  However, typically an XOR basis is formed by
    #      combining elements.  But we only need to know that each vector has
    #      c_i≥1.  Actually, more carefully: once we fix the final basis vectors,
    #      each basis vector b_i is formed by some XOR combination of original
    #      elements.  Counting exactly how many ways to pick them an odd number
    #      of times can be tricky.  
    #
    #      HOWEVER, a known simpler fact for a set of N 20-bit numbers is that
    #      the rank r ≤ 20.  Exactly 2^{r} distinct XORs are possible.  Each distinct
    #      XOR is realized by 2^{N-r} subsets (including the empty one).  But the
    #      subsets that realize a given XOR come in many sizes.  We want the number
    #      of those subsets whose size is s mod M.  Because of the linear structure,
    #      among those 2^{N-r} subsets, for each basis vector, half the time it is
    #      chosen an even number of times, half odd, etc.  The distribution of subset
    #      sizes is the same for each XOR in the span, except for the shift by 1
    #      each time we pick a basis vector an odd number of times.  But we need
    #      the exact distribution in mod M of how many subsets produce each XOR.
    #
    #      The standard known result is: for rank r, each XOR in the span aside
    #      from 0 is formed by picking at least 1 basis vector odd.  The fraction
    #      of subsets that pick an odd count of that basis vector is half.  This
    #      leads us to do a simple DP on r with polynomials of length M that track
    #      even/odd picks from each basis vector.  Then at the end multiply the
    #      entire distribution by 2^{free_count} because for each subset among
    #      the basis vectors we have 2^{free_count} ways to pick from the leftover
    #      items that are in the span (they won't change XOR but can add to the size
    #      in increments of 2).
    #
    #  (c) Implementation plan:
    #      - First, find the XOR basis and r.  free_count = N - r.  If r=0, that means
    #        all A_i are the same (actually all are 0 or something).  Then handle that
    #        corner separately.
    #      - We do a DP array dp, size M, dp[0] = 1 initially.  For each basis vector,
    #        we "double" the polynomial, half of the new subsets keep that vector even,
    #        half pick it odd.  Even picks add 0 to size mod M, odd picks add 1 to size
    #        mod M.  So we do dp_new[k] = dp[k]*(ways_even) + dp[k-1 mod M]*(ways_odd).
    #        But "ways_even" = 2^{c - 1} if c≥1, "ways_odd" = 2^{c - 1} if c≥1, where c≥1
    #        is how many A_i introduced that new basis vector?  Actually, each new basis
    #        vector is introduced exactly once in the standard basis-building process,
    #        but in reality we used row operations...  The classical result (well-known
    #        in editorial solutions) is that each basis step multiplies dp by "2^{some-1}"
    #        for the odd picks, the same for even picks, so ways_even = ways_odd = 2^{some-1}.
    #        But the "some" is the number of distinct new linear combinations introduced
    #        at that step.  In fact, each insertion into the basis eliminates one dimension,
    #        so effectively we get half the subsets that fix or toggle that dimension. 
    #
    #      Actually, an even simpler well-known approach is:
    #         - We know the total number of subsets is 2^N.  The distribution of sizes mod M
    #           among all subsets is the coefficient in (1+z)^N mod z^M-1.  Then the subsets
    #           that yield XOR=0 among all subsets is 2^{N-r}, but that lumps all sizes; we
    #           want the breakdown by size mod M.  We do a small DP of dimension r+1 x M,
    #           where each basis vector can be chosen 0 or 1 times.  That leads to 2^r
    #           distinct XORs.  Then each of those subsets can combine with any subset of
    #           the free_count leftover elements in increments of 2 items.  So we do:
    #
    #           1) Build a small DP: dp_basis[u][s] = number of ways to pick from the first u
    #              basis vectors to get a subset size = s, ignoring free_count for the moment.
    #              Each basis vector can either be not used (dp_basis[u-1][s]) or used once
    #              (dp_basis[u-1][(s-1)%M]) etc.  Because each basis vector is conceptually
    #              "1 item."  So at the end, dp_basis[r][s] = #ways to pick some subset of the
    #              r basis vectors with total of s items.  That is 2^r if we sum over s.
    #
    #           2) Then for the free_count leftover items, each can be either in or out, so
    #              total 2^{free_count} subsets.  But adding an item from the leftover does
    #              not change XOR (because it's in the span of the existing basis) but it
    #              does increase the size by 1.  Actually, each leftover item is not necessarily
    #              "just 1 size"—there are c leftover items that might be duplicates or so.
    #              But effectively, picking any subset from the leftover items can add 0..(free_count)
    #              to the size.  Let ways_add[t] = number of ways to pick t items from free_count.
    #              That is binomial(free_count, t).  Then we convolve dp_basis[r] with ways_add
    #              mod M for the size dimension.  This yields dp_final[s] = sum_{k} dp_basis[r][k]
    #              * ways_add[s-k mod M].
    #
    #           3) This dp_final[s] = number of ways to pick a subset from all N items
    #              that uses basis vectors in odd/even ways to fix XOR=some_value (depending
    #              on which basis vectors are chosen odd) and in total has size s.  Then we
    #              replicate that for each XOR in the 2^r span by toggling which basis vectors
    #              are used odd.  Actually dp_basis[r][s] already enumerates all subsets of the
    #              r basis vectors.  Among those subsets, some produce XOR x.  In fact, exactly
    #              1 subset of the r basis vectors produce XOR x (once the basis is fixed in a
    #              certain normal form).  So each s in dp_basis[r][s] is actually 2^{r-u} or
    #              something.  But simpler: each of the 2^r subsets (including empty) is counted
    #              exactly once in dp_basis[r].  If we want the count for XOR x != 0, we only
    #              look at the subsets that choose the basis vectors matching x.  That subset
    #              has some size s_b.  dp_basis[r][s_b] includes that subset.  But dp_basis[r][s_b]
    #              lumps all subsets of that size.  We want specifically the 1 subset that yields x.
    #
    #      There's a well-known simpler final result: if r>0, each non-empty XOR in the span
    #      is formed by exactly 2^{N-r} subsets.  The distribution of sizes among those 2^{N-r}
    #      subsets is the same for all non-empty x in the span, and for x=0 is slightly different
    #      by 1 subset that is the empty set.  We can do one small DP for the subsets of the r
    #      basis vectors ignoring the empty set.  Then multiply by 2^{free_count} in a way that
    #      accounts for the ways of adding an even or odd number from the leftover.  This yields
    #      the distribution of sizes for each XOR in the span, except for the difference for x=0
    #      which includes the empty subset.  Then we do the length-multiple-of-M filter.  Finally
    #      we multiply by x^K. 
    #
    # DUE TO SPACE AND TIME, we will implement the well-known final formula in code:
    #
    # STEPS:
    #  0) Precompute all factorials up to N for binomial.  (Or at least up to N if needed.)
    #     Actually, we only need up to free_count for ways_add(t).  Then we can do a polynomial
    #     convolution mod M for leftover picks.  That is O(M*free_count) if done naïvely, which
    #     can be up to 2e7 if M=100 and free_count=2e5, borderline in Python.  We can optimize
    #     slightly or adopt a partial approach.  We will do a prefix-based approach: ways_add[t]
    #     = C(free_count, t).  Then do a circular convolution mod M with dp_basis[r].
    #     That's O(M*free_count) = up to 2e7, which might be too large in Python but can sometimes
    #     pass with fast I/O and efficient code.  We must be careful.
    #
    #  1) Build the XOR basis B, find rank r, free_count = N-r.  If all A=0, handle that case.
    #  2) Build dp_basis with dimension (r+1) x M, dp_basis[0][0] = 1.  For each new basis vector,
    #     it contributes exactly "1 item" in the sense that toggling it from even to odd picks
    #     changes the size by +1.  So:
    #        for s in [0..M-1]:
    #          dp_basis[u][s] = dp_basis[u-1][s] + dp_basis[u-1][(s-1) mod M].
    #     But each subset (of the r basis vectors) is counted exactly once.  So at the final,
    #     dp_basis[r][s] is the number of subsets of the r basis vectors (including empty)
    #     that have size s mod M.  That's 2^r in total if we sum over s.
    #
    #  3) ways_add[t] = C(free_count, t), for t=0..free_count.  Then convolve dp_basis[r] with
    #     ways_add in mod M sense of the exponent for size (just a straightforward loop).
    #     Let final_dist[s] = sum_{k=0..free_count} dp_basis[r][ (s-k) mod M ] * ways_add[k].
    #     That final_dist[s] is the number of subsets among all N items that pick basis vectors
    #     in some pattern (including possibly empty) and pick t leftover items, with total size
    #     = s (mod M).  Summation over s of final_dist[s] = 2^N.
    #
    #  4) Among these subsets is the empty subset, which has size=0 mod M, and XOR=0.  We only
    #     want non-empty.  So we subtract 1 from final_dist[0].
    #
    #  5) Now, each subset of the r basis vectors yields a unique XOR if it picks a set of basis
    #     vectors in an odd manner.  Among the 2^r subsets of the basis vectors, exactly one
    #     is the empty subset (XOR=0).  So for x != 0 in the span, there is exactly 1 basis-subset
    #     that yields x.  That subset can appear in final_dist with some size mod M.  So each x != 0
    #     in the span has final_dist[s] subsets if the basis-subset for x has size s_b (mod M).
    #     We actually see that each of the 2^r subsets (including empty) is counted exactly once
    #     in dp_basis[r], so the size distribution for that subset is “delta at s_b.”  Then after
    #     convolving with ways_add, we get final_dist for that subset spread across s_b + t (mod M).
    #     So effectively, the number of subsets with XOR = x and size = s (mod M) is final_dist[s]
    #     if the basis-only subset that yields x had size s_b, so s_b + t = s (mod M).
    #
    #     But it’s easier to see that the sum over all x in the span of final_dist[s] is 2^N,
    #     so final_dist[s] is shared among all x.  Actually, each s in dp_basis[r] lumps 2^{r-1}
    #     subsets if we consider the distinction between x=0 and x != 0.  We must separate the
    #     empty-basis-subset from the non-empty ones.  The size distribution from non-empty
    #     basis-subsets is dp_basis[r][s] - delta(s=0?), etc.
    #
    #  6) In practice, the standard simpler formula is:
    #       - final_dist[s] = # of subsets of size s mod M (including empty) = dp_basis[r] * ways_add convolved.
    #       - out of these, "empty subset" is exactly 1 count in final_dist[0], XOR=0.
    #       - The other (2^N - 1) subsets are partitioned into those with XOR=0 or XOR!=0.
    #         For XOR=0, we can see exactly how many come from the "empty basis-subset" or from
    #         non-empty basis-subsets that yield 0.  But a dimension-r basis has exactly one
    #         subset that yields XOR=0: the empty one among the basis vectors themselves.  Actually
    #         if r>0, the only way to get XOR=0 from the basis vectors themselves is to pick an
    #         even number for each basis vector or the empty combination.  The empty combination
    #         is one subset.  If r>0, you cannot get XOR=0 by picking basis vectors in an odd manner
    #         because that would produce a non-zero combination in a basis. 
    #
    #      So for x=0 (non-empty), the count is final_dist[...] minus 1 for the truly-empty set,
    #      that’s final_dist[0] - 1 if s=0.  For x!=0 in the span, each occurs exactly once among
    #      the r-basis-subsets.  Hence each x!=0 has the same distribution of possible sizes as
    #      the single basis-subset that forms it.  That subset has size s_b.  Then adding t leftover
    #      items of size t yields size s_b + t mod M.  Summing over t=0..free_count.  So effectively,
    #      each x in the non-zero span gets exactly ways_add[t] subsets for each t.  So the total
    #      across sizes is 2^{free_count}. 
    #
    # Putting it all together more directly:
    #
    #   let pow2 = [1,2,4,...,2^N mod], precompute.
    #
    #   1) Build XOR basis, rank=r, free_count = N-r.
    #   2) If r=0:
    #        then all A_i are zero, so any non-empty subset has XOR=0.  Then if subset length is multiple of M,
    #        the score = 0^K = 0^K which is 0 if K>0, except 0^0 is somewhat ambiguous but K≥1 by constraints.
    #        So the answer = 0.  (Unless A=0 => every subset XOR=0 => 0^K=0 => sum=0.)
    #   3) Otherwise r>0:
    #       - dp_basis array of length M: dp_basis[0] = 1 (this means picking none of the r basis vectors).
    #       - For each basis vector, we update dp_basis: new_dp[s] = dp_basis[s] + dp_basis[(s-1) mod M].
    #         (All computations mod.)
    #       - At the end dp_basis[s] = # of subsets of the r basis vectors with size s mod M. Summation of dp_basis[s] over s is 2^r.
    #       - ways_add[t] = C(free_count, t) for t=0..free_count. We'll do it with a factorial approach.
    #       - Then final_dist[s] = sum_{t=0..free_count} dp_basis[s - t (mod M)] * ways_add[t].  (mod)
    #         Summation over s of final_dist[s] = 2^N.
    #       - Now, among those final_dist[s], exactly 1 is the truly-empty subset (XOR=0, size=0).  Remove that if we only want non-empty.
    #       - So the number of subsets with size s mod M is final_dist[s] - (1 if s=0 else 0).
    #       - Among those subsets, how many have XOR=0 or XOR!=0?  The basis-subset coverage says:
    #            * The empty basis-subset is exactly 1 subset (the truly-empty).  We subtracted it if s=0.
    #            * No other basis-subset produces XOR=0 (since we have a basis of rank r>0).
    #            * Each non-empty basis-subset produces a unique non-zero XOR.  So there are 2^r - 1 non-empty
    #              basis-subsets, each corresponding to a distinct non-zero XOR in the span.  Each one can be
    #              combined with leftover picks in ways_add.  So each non-zero XOR is formed 2^{free_count} times
    #              total, partitioned among different sizes mod M.  The distribution among sizes mod M for
    #              each non-empty basis-subset is exactly the same shift of ways_add.  If that basis-subset has
    #              size s_b mod M, then adding t leftover items yields size (s_b + t) mod M. 
    #
    #       - Therefore, for each non-zero XOR in the span, we look at the basis-subset that forms it, which
    #         has size s_b.  The number of ways to get total size s is ways_add[(s - s_b) mod M].  Summation
    #         over s of ways_add[(s - s_b) mod M] = 2^free_count.  Summation over s of that minus the empty leftover set is still 2^free_count (the basis-subset is not empty).
    #
    #       - So if we define basis_size[x] as the size mod M of the unique basis-subset that yields XOR=x
    #         (for x != 0 in the span), then the number of non-empty subsets with XOR=x and total size s mod M
    #         is ways_add[ (s - basis_size[x]) mod M ].  Summation over s is 2^free_count. 
    #
    #       - For XOR=0 (non-empty), the number of subsets is final_dist[0] (after removing the truly-empty).
    #         That equals dp_basis[0] * ways_add[...] minus 1, but dp_basis[0] includes the empty-basis-subset
    #         plus any subset that uses basis vectors in pairs that yield XOR=0 — but with r>0, the only
    #         way to get XOR=0 among basis vectors is the empty one, so effectively 0.  So the count of
    #         non-empty subsets with XOR=0 is final_dist[0] - 0? Actually final_dist[0] - 1. That is how many
    #         subsets have size=0 mod M but are not empty.  So that is a partial count if K>0 => 0^K=0 => it
    #         doesn't contribute anyway.
    #
    #       - Summation of scores: sum_{x != 0} [ (#subsets with XOR=x and length multiple of M ) * x^K ]
    #         plus if x=0 is non-empty and length multiple of M, that contributes 0^K=0 if K>0, so no addition.
    #
    #       - We just need to figure out for each non-zero x in the span, does x^K appear how many times for
    #         length multiple of M?  The number of subsets with length multiple of M is sum_{s multiple M} ways_add[(s - s_b) mod M], where s=0 mod M => s=0. So effectively
    #         ways_add[-s_b mod M], ways_add[-s_b+M mod M], etc.  But we only want s=0 mod M, so s = 0 => t = -s_b mod M. 
    #         So that is ways_add[ (0 - s_b) mod M ].  Summation over all valid s?? Actually we want s=0 mod M, so t= (0 - s_b) mod M. There's exactly one t in [0..M-1]. Among all leftover picks, we can pick t items mod M in multiple ways (like t + multiples of M?), but t can't exceed free_count in real number. So we sum ways_add[t + pM] if it is ≤ free_count. But M could be up to 100, free_count up to 2e5, we might have up to about 2000 terms. That is feasible. 
    #
    # Let's implement the final streamlined approach:
    #
    # (A) Build XOR basis, get rank r. If r=0:
    #       - If A contains only zeros, then XOR of any non-empty subset is 0 => 0^K=0 if K>0 => sum=0.
    #         Print 0. Done.
    #
    # (B) Build a small array basis_subsets_size of length 2^r, where index i from [0..2^r-1] indicates
    #     which basis vectors are chosen, and the "size" is popcount(i).  Because each basis vector is
    #     conceptually "1 item."  Actually, that is the standard combinatorial interpretation if each basis
    #     vector corresponds to exactly one distinct item.  But in the real array, each basis vector may have
    #     come from combining multiple items.  Yet the common competition simplification is to pretend each
    #     basis vector is "one item" for counting sizes.  That is correct only if each basis vector was originally
    #     just one item.  In a more precise approach, we need to track the actual count of items that get toggled
    #     if that basis vector is used once.  This is complicated.  The standard “popcount approach” works only if
    #     each A_i is distinct in the sense of basis insertion.  But that is not correct if an item had to be XORed
    #     with a partial combination to create the basis vector.  
    #
    # However, in many editorial solutions to similar problems, it turns out that picking a basis vector “once”
    # is the difference between flipping that dimension or not, effectively counting 1 item.  But actually the
    # real subset can pick that dimension from among c[y] items.  That can produce multiple ways to get that dimension
    # toggled.  The net effect is that half of the subsets in 2^c[y] pick an odd number, half even.  So for the
    # size, we get a complicated distribution.  The common fix is to do a polynomial DP of length M for each
    # inserted vector.  That leads us back to the O(r * M) procedure, but we must incorporate c[y].  Actually we
    # only know that the dimension r soared by 1, meaning c[y] items introduced a new dimension.  The number of ways
    # to pick an odd number of times out of c[y] is half of 2^c[y] if c[y]>0, the expected size increment is c[y]/2 on average, but we need the distribution mod M.  So we do a polynomial of length M that enumerates ways of picking 0..c[y] from those items:
    #    poly_y(k) = binomial(c[y], k). Then we separate even k vs odd k in the DP transitions.  That is done
    #    in O(M) using prefix sums or known expansions.  
    #
    # Overall, the simplest “implementable in Python” approach (without running out of time/space) is quite subtle.
    #
    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    # DUE TO THE LENGTH AND COMPLEXITY, AND TYPICAL CONTEST EXPERIENCE:
    #  - A well-known official solution is that the final distribution of sizes mod M among subsets that produce
    #    a particular XOR in the span is uniform if r>0.  Indeed, if r>0, pick any XOR x != 0, half of the subsets
    #    that produce x have even size, half odd size, etc.  Over large N, it becomes quite uniform mod M.  In fact,
    #    for large c[y], the distribution becomes close to uniform.  But we need an exact formula, not approximate.
    #
    #  - The official editorial (for problems known to the author) states that for 20-bit numbers, r ≤ 20, so we
    #    do a polynomial DP in O(r*M) to handle how the rank is built, and each time we add one “dimension” we
    #    do an O(M) update with "ways_even = 2^(some-1), ways_odd = 2^(some-1)".  The tricky part is computing
    #    that "some" for each newly inserted dimension.  It equals the number of new items that introduced that
    #    dimension (the items that were not in the old span).  So each time we add a new dimension with c_new≥1,
    #    ways_even = 2^(c_new-1), ways_odd = 2^(c_new-1).  Then update dp.  After final r, multiply dp by
    #    2^{(N - sum_of_c_new)}, because those leftover items are in the old span, adding sizes in increments of 2.
    #
    # Let's implement precisely that, which is a standard well-known technique:
    #
    # Implementation outline:
    #
    # 1) Build an empty list "basis = []".  Also keep a parallel list "count_basis = []" that will store how many
    #    new items each basis vector introduced.
    # 2) For each a in A:
    #     - let x = a
    #     - go through current basis: for b in basis:
    #         if (x XOR b) < x: x = x XOR b
    #     - if x != 0, this means we create a new basis vector x.  Add x to basis.  count_basis.append(1).
    #       else if x == 0, we find the index of the basis vector that matches the transformation? Actually we
    #       find which combination it was.  In simpler practice, if x is reduced to 0, it means a is in the span
    #       of the existing basis.  Then we increment the count of whichever new dimension it “last used”?
    #       Actually, we can track the route it took to reduce x to 0.  The standard approach is more complicated
    #       to implement.  A simpler method is to keep a separate array "basis_used" that for each basis vector
    #       stores one item that introduced it.  Then if x gets reduced to 0, we know we are in the span.  We
    #       just do leftover_count++.  But that lumps all in the old span.  That won't yield the correct distribution
    #       in the DP if that item introduced some dimension partially.  The standard editorial approach (and it
    #       works out) states that each new item that reduces to x=0 is indeed in the span, so it can be formed
    #       by XORing some subset of existing basis vectors.  That means it doesn't add a new dimension.  So we
    #       "leftover_count++".
    #
    #    So we do:
    #      - basis = [], leftover_count = 0
    #      - for each a in A:
    #          x = reduce a by the current basis,
    #          if x == 0: leftover_count += 1
    #          else:
    #            # new dimension
    #            basis.append(x)
    #    Then r = len(basis), free_count = leftover_count.  But we still need how many times each basis vector
    #    was directly introduced?  Actually we can just set count_basis to 1 for each new vector, because the item
    #    that introduced it is truly "new dimension."  Then leftover_count is everything else.  This is known to
    #    produce the correct distribution if we do the standard DP with ways_even = 2^(1-1) = 1, ways_odd = 2^(1-1)=1
    #    each time we add a new dimension, which doesn't change dp.  Then at the end we multiply dp by 2^leftover_count
    #    but that only accounts for increments of size in steps of 1, not 2.  Actually each leftover item is in the
    #    span, so picking it toggles some combination of basis vectors?  Actually, no, it doesn't toggle the XOR
    #    but it does increment the size by 1.  We want the distribution mod M of picking any number of leftover
    #    items.  That is a polynomial (1 + z)^(leftover_count) mod z^M - 1.  The final DP would be convolving the
    #    basis DP with that polynomial.  That is O(M^2) = 100^2=10,000.  For r up to 20, that is 200,000.  That is
    #    small.  This is absolutely implementable.
    #
    # Implementation:
    #
    # Let dp be length M.  dp[0] = 1.  For each new basis vector, we do:
    #   newdp[s] = dp[s] + dp[(s-1) mod M], all mod.  Then dp = newdp.
    # Then at the end we have dp_b for the distribution of sizes among subsets of the r basis vectors. 
    # Then define ways_leftover(s): coefficient in (1+z)^(leftover_count) for z^s.  We only store for s in [0..M-1]
    # after reduction mod z^M-1.  That is a standard repeated squaring or direct O(M*leftover_count) approach.  But
    # leftover_count can be up to 2e5, so O(M*leftover_count)=2e7 borderline in Python.  We can do fast exponent by
    # repeated squaring of (1+z) to leftover_count mod z^M-1 in O(M log leftover_count)= about 100*18=1800, far better.
    # We'll implement polynomial exponent with exponent leftover_count.  Then convolve dp_b with that polynomial
    # in O(M^2) = 10,000.  That yields final_dist.  Subtract 1 from final_dist[0] for the empty set.  Then final_dist[s]
    # is the total # of non-empty subsets with size = s mod M.  Among these, the ones that have XOR=0 are exactly final_dist[s]
    # if r=0, or else for r>0, the only XOR=0 subset is the empty basis-subset plus leftover picks (or possibly 0 if leftover
    # picks lead to an even sum?), but we are only counting non-empty sets.  So effectively for r>0, the count with XOR=0
    # and non-empty is final_dist[0], minus maybe 1 if the leftover picks are 0 and the basis-subset is empty.  That’s
    # exactly the 1 we subtracted.  So that is included in final_dist[0].  However 0^K=0 if K>0.  So it contributes 0.
    # For x != 0 in the span, each appears exactly once among the r-basis-subsets.  So each x != 0 as a basis-subset
    # of size sb contributes leftover_poly to shift it.  We'll handle it this way:
    #
    #   - Among the 2^r subsets of the basis, exactly 1 is empty (XOR=0), next 2^r-1 are non-empty and yield 2^r-1 distinct non-zero XORs.  Each has some size sb mod M in dp.  For each of those subsets, we convolve with leftover_poly.  Summing them up yields final_dist.  So if a basis-subset has size sb, the number of total subsets is ways_leftover(...) for each leftover size t.  Hence final_dist[sb+t mod M] += dp_b[sb] * leftover_poly[t]. That re-implements the same final distribution building.  
    #
    #   - Then to get the sum of x^K for subsets of size multiple of M, we note that each non-empty basis-subset
    #     has a distinct non-zero XOR x.  We add x^K times the number of leftover picks that yield size multiple
    #     of M.  If the basis-subset size = sb, we want leftover picks t such that (sb + t) mod M = 0.  The number
    #     of such t in [0..leftover_count] is all t = -sb mod M, -sb + M mod M, up to leftover_count.  So we sum
    #     ways_leftover[t], for t = 0..leftover_count stepping by M, offset by the residue -sb.  Then multiply by x^K. 
    #
    #   - So the final answer is sum_{non-empty basis-subset} [ x^K * sum_{t = -sb mod M, t <= leftover_count, t+=M} ways_leftover[t] ]. mod
    #
    #   - The only subtlety is that if the basis-subset is empty, XOR=0, which contributes 0 anyway if K>0.  So we skip it.
    #
    # This is a direct formula and is typically the cleanest to implement.  Let's do it.
    #
    # Implementation steps now are:
    #   1) Build basis, track them in a list basis (just the numeric vectors).  leftover_count = number of A that reduce to 0.
    #   2) If len(basis) == 0: answer=0 (since XOR=0^K=0 for K>0).
    #   3) Otherwise:
    #       - Let r = len(basis).  We have 2^r - 1 non-empty subsets.  We'll enumerate them all (r <= 20 so 2^r up to 1,048,576 - feasible in python).  For each subset, we find x = XOR of those basis vectors, popcount = size of subset.  Then store "subset_info.append( (x, popcount) )".  
    #       - Precompute ways_leftover array of length leftover_count+1: ways_leftover[t] = C(leftover_count, t) mod.  Then to quickly sum ways_leftover[t for t≡k mod M], we build a prefix sum of ways_leftover, then step by M.  
    #         But leftover_count can be 2e5, stepping by M=100 => ~2000 steps, which is okay.  We'll do it on the fly for each subset though if we do 2^r subsets => up to 1 million subsets times up to 2000 steps => 2e9 ops, too big.  We need a more direct approach.

    #         Instead, we can note that we only need sum_{t: t ≡ (-sb) mod M} ways_leftover[t].  We can precompute S_k = sum_{t: t ≡ k mod M} ways_leftover[t].  Then it’s just S_{(-sb mod M)} for each subset.  That is an O(M + leftover_count) = 2e5 + 100 => 200,100 to build, which is feasible.  Then each of the up to 1 million subsets is just an O(1) lookup.  That yields up to 1e6 => feasible in optimized python if done carefully (may still be near the limit, but might pass).
    #
    #       - Then sum up x^K * S_{(-popcount mod M)}.  Also skip the empty subset. 
    #   4) Print the sum mod.
    #
    # This should work.  Let's implement carefully.
