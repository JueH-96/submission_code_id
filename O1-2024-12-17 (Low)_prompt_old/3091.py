        """
        We want to count all sub-multisets of 'nums' whose sums lie in [l, r].
        A standard "subset count" dynamic-programming approach works here,
        but we must be mindful that the array can be large (up to 20,000 elements),
        yet the total sum of elements also does not exceed 20,000. These constraints
        guide us toward a DP over sums up to 20,000, rather than over subsets.

        Key idea:
          - Let S = sum(nums). We cannot have any sub-multiset with sum > S.
          - We'll use a DP array dp[] of size (S+1), where dp[s] = the number of ways to form sum s
            from the elements seen so far.
          - We'll incorporate each (nonzero) element one at a time, updating dp via a prefix-sum
            technique to keep it O(n*S).
          - Zeros are handled separately, since choosing any number of zeros does not change the sum.
            If there are z zeros, each sum that is achievable can be combined with any subset of the zeros
            (2^z ways) for that same sum.

        Steps:
          1. Count how many zeros are in `nums` => z. Filter them out so we only do the DP on nonzero values.
          2. Let dp[0] = 1 initially (the empty subset).
          3. For each nonzero x in nums:
               - Build prefix array prefix[i] = dp[0] + dp[1] + ... + dp[i], in mod.
               - Then dp[i] = prefix[i] - prefix[i - x - 1] (if i - x - 1 >= 0), else prefix[i].
                 (This sums up dp[i - k*x] for k=0..1, but done in O(1) via prefix.)
          4. At the end, multiply every dp[s] by 2^z, because for each sum s achieved by nonzero elements,
             we can attach any subset of the z zeros (including possibly none).
          5. Finally, sum dp[s] over s from l..r, taking care that r does not exceed S and if l > S the result is 0.
          6. Return answer modulo 1e9+7.
