        We have an odd integer k and must choose exactly k disjoint subarrays from nums.
        Once chosen, we can arrange those k subarrays in any order we like in the strength formula:

            strength = sum_{i=1..k} [(-1)^(i+1) * (sum_of_subarray_i) * (k - i + 1)]

        Because k is odd, the formula has (k+1)//2 positive multipliers and (k-1)//2 negative multipliers,
        specifically (for i from 1..k, 1-based):
            M[1] = +k
            M[2] = -(k-1)
            M[3] = +(k-2)
            M[4] = -(k-3)
            ...
            M[k] = +1   (since k is odd)

        Crucially, we can reorder our chosen subarrays arbitrarily when plugging them into that formula.
        In other words, if we end up with some chosen subarrays whose sums are s_1, s_2, ..., s_k,
        we get to permute them so that the largest sums match the larger positive multipliers,
        and the most negative sums match the negative multipliers (which effectively become positive
        once multiplied by the negative multiplier).

        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        HIGH-LEVEL IDEA
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        1) Because we may freely reorder the chosen subarrays in the formula, the "position" i in the
           formula is not tied to their physical order in nums; it only affects whether the subarray's
           sum is multiplied by a positive or negative coefficient and by how large that coefficient is.

        2) Since k is odd, there will be exactly p = (k+1)//2 "positive slots" in the strength formula
           and q = (k-1)//2 "negative slots".  Thus:
               - The p subarrays we assign to the positive slots will be multiplied by
                 k, (k-2), (k-4), etc., all positive.
               - The q subarrays we assign to the negative slots will be multiplied by
                 -(k-1), -(k-3), -(k-5), etc.  A negative subarray sum is desirable there (since a negative
                 times a negative is positive).

        3) Intuitively, we want to pick:
               - p subarrays whose sums are as large as possible (for the positive multipliers).
               - q subarrays whose sums are as negative as possible (i.e. very negative) for the negative multipliers.
           BUT all these subarrays (p + q = k total) must be pairwise disjoint.  There is a trade-off:
           sometimes, forcing in an extremely negative subarray for the negative slot might block
           a very large positive subarray, or vice versa, if they overlap.  We must find an optimal
           selection of exactly k disjoint subarrays overall that maximizes the final strength.

        4) A direct "pick p subarrays maximizing sum" + "pick q subarrays minimizing sum" won't necessarily
           work if those picks are done independently, because they may overlap or block each other in suboptimal ways.

        5) However, once we fix exactly which k subarrays are chosen (all disjoint), the optimal way to
           place them in the formula is:
               - Sort the chosen subarray sums in descending order.
               - Pair the largest positive multipliers with the largest sums,
                 and pair the negative multipliers with the most negative sums.

           Formally, let subSums = [s_1, s_2, ..., s_k] be the sums of the chosen k subarrays.
           Sort subSums descending  →  x_1 >= x_2 >= ... >= x_k.
           Then let the positive multipliers in descending order be p_1 >= p_2 >= ... >= p_( (k+1)//2 ),
           and the negative multipliers in descending order by absolute value be n_1 <= n_2 <= ... <= n_( (k-1)//2 )
           (note each n_j is negative, but |n_1| >= |n_2| >= ...).
           We assign the top p = (k+1)//2 of the x_i's to the p_j's, and the remaining q = (k-1)//2 of the x_i's
           (the smaller ones) to the n_j's.  That assignment yields the maximum possible sum from
           sum_{r=1..p} x_r * p_r   +   sum_{r=1..q} x_{p+r} * n_r.

        6) The main difficulty is determining which EXACT k disjoint subarrays to pick to maximize
           that final re-arranged sum.  A known (but fairly tricky) way is to do a dynamic program
           over the number of chosen subarrays (both "positive" and "negative" ones combined), carefully
           keeping track of partial picks.  However, that can become large if done naively.

        7) A workable approach for n up to 10^4, k up to n, and n*k up to 10^6 is to do a DP over
           intervals plus a "greedy assignment" of signs at the end.  One standard technique is:
              - Enumerate all subarray sums in O(n^2).  For each subarray (L,R), store the sum, and note
                its interval.
              - We then want to choose at most k intervals (exactly k, in fact) that are pairwise disjoint
                and whose final arrangement (with sign multipliers) is as large as possible.
              - Because k ≤ n and n*k ≤ 10^6, an O(n^2) enumeration is borderline but often still doable
                if carefully implemented in optimized Python or C++ (since 10^4 * 10^4 = 10^8 can be too
                big in Python, but can sometimes pass with pruning or fast IO—depends on test constraints).
              - Having all intervals with their sums, we do a "weighted interval scheduling" style DP:
                where the "weight" of an interval is not just its raw sum, but we must consider that
                large positive sums and large negative sums are each valuable in different ways.

           In practice, one can do a more direct DP that simultaneously tries to insert each possible
           subarray either into our chosen set or skip it, using a top-down approach and storing partial
           solutions in a data structure.  This, however, is advanced to implement under time constraints.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        SIMPLIFIED (BUT ACCEPTABLE) SOLUTION OUTLINE / DP
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        The solution below implements a combined DP of dimension O(n * k * 2) that is inspired by
        the classic "pick j non-overlapping subarrays with maximum total sum" algorithm repeated
        for both 'maximum' and 'minimum' subarrays.  We then combine them in one pass, using the fact
        that we ultimately reorder them:

           Let dp_pos[j][i] = maximum sum we can get by picking j disjoint subarrays from
                              nums[:i] (the first i elements, 0-based) all for the "positive group."
           Let dp_neg[j][i] = minimum sum we can get by picking j disjoint subarrays from
                              nums[:i], all for the "negative group."

        We can build these up in O(n*k) each using a known technique: 
            - Keep track of best subarray sums ending exactly at position i-1,
              then transitions that either use that subarray or skip it.
        After we have dp_pos and dp_neg, we still need to combine exactly p=(k+1)//2 from the positive group
        and q=(k-1)//2 from the negative group *disjointly* across the entire array.  Naively, one might try
        splitting the array or layering dp_pos + dp_neg, but that can fail if positive and negative subarrays
        nest or interleave.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        REMARK:
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        In truth, implementing the fully correct solution so that positive- and negative-sum subarrays
        can interleave arbitrarily (and remain disjoint) is nontrivial.  A classical approach is a
        "3D DP": dp[i][p][q], enumerating up to i with p picked as positives, q picked as negatives.
        Then you have transitions based on whether you take a new subarray ending at i, either as a
        "positive" or "negative" pick, or skip i.  Finally you assign multiplier weights in the end
        by sorting the chosen subarrays by their sums (descending if positive, ascending if negative)
        and computing the final strength.

        The code below shows that 3D DP approach.  It keeps track only of the partial sets' sums
        in "two buckets": positive sums chosen and negative sums chosen.  However, we also need
        to be able to add a newly-chosen subarray sum in the correct bucket (depending on sign).
        Because subarray sums can be positive or negative, we do a Kadane-like sub-problem for
        "best subarray sum ending at i" and "best subarray sum (most negative) ending at i" and
        incorporate them.  Then dp[i][p][q] = best possible combination of p positive-subarray-sums
        and q negative-subarray-sums using indices < i (so disjoint up to i).

        After populating dp[n][p][q], we get two multi-sets: the p chosen positive sums and the q chosen
        negative sums.  But to handle the final weighting, we only need the sum of positives and the sum of
        negatives in sorted order.  That in turn means we must keep track not just of the total "raw sum",
        but the actual sorted lists of subarray sums.  Storing lists of length up to k in dp would be large.

        To keep this demonstration concise, we will store partial sets in each DP cell (which can
        be memory-heavy but workable for n*k up to 10^6 with careful implementation).
        Then at the end dp[n][p][q] holds the best pair of sorted-lists: one ascending (negatives) and
        one descending (positives).  We merge them with the respective multipliers.

        NOTE: This is a non-trivial implementation.  Below is a sketch that does exactly that, but in
        practice, one should carefully optimize.  The idea here is to give a correct reference solution.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        STEP BY STEP:
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Let best_end_pos[i] = maximum subarray sum that ends exactly at index i.
        Let best_end_neg[i] = minimum (most negative) subarray sum that ends exactly at index i.
        We can get these arrays in O(n) with Kadane's method for positives and for negatives.

        Then define dp[i][p][q] = a pair (bestPosList, bestNegList),
        where bestPosList is the sorted list (descending) of sums of the p chosen positive subarrays
        among indices < i, and bestNegList is the sorted list (ascending) of sums of the q chosen negative subarrays
        among indices < i.  "best" means they maximize the final usage potential.

        Transition:
          - dp[i][p][q] can be taken from dp[i-1][p][q] (skip i).
          - Or if we choose a positive subarray ending at i-1, say sum = best_end_pos[i-1], we merge that sum
            into dp[start][p-1][q] where 'start' is one position before the beginning of that subarray.
          - Similarly for a negative subarray sum = best_end_neg[i-1].

        We keep the best result in dp[i][p][q] by comparing final "strength" possible from the stored lists.
        Because we only need the final arrangement at i=n, we compare dp[n][p][q].  Then we compute the strength
        by pairing its p positive sums (descending) with the k, k-2, ..., multipliers and its q negative sums
        (ascending) with the -(k-1), -(k-3), ... multipliers.

        This solution is fairly heavy.  Below is a more compact but still conceptually similar version
        that stores partial solutions.  In practice one can optimize memory usage by rolling arrays, etc.
        The main point is correctness for the asked problem.
