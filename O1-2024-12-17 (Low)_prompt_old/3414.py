        # Observing the pattern from the examples and small cases

        # (allowing revisits and the given move constraints) is 2^(k+1).
        #
        # Example checks:
        #  - k=0 => result=2
        #  - k=1 => result=4
        # Both match the formula 2^(k+1).
        #
        # For large k (up to 10^9), directly computing 2^(k+1)
        # is feasible in Python due to its built-in support for
        # arbitrary-precision integers.
