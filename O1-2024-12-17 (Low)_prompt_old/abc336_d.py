    # We want to find the maximum k such that a contiguous subarray of A
    # of length (2k-1) can be turned into the Pyramid Sequence:
    # 1, 2, ..., k-1, k, k-1, ..., 2, 1
    #
    # Operations allowed:
    # 1) Decrease any element by 1 (any number of times).
    # 2) Remove elements from either the front or the back of A.
    #
    # Removing from ends can isolate a contiguous subarray. Then we only need
    # each element in that subarray to be â‰¥ the corresponding Pyramid Sequence value
    # so we can decrement it to match. The question reduces to finding:
    #   "Is there a contiguous subarray of length 2k-1 whose i-th element is >=
    #    the i-th value of the pyramid pattern for i=1..2k-1?"
    #
    # We'll use binary search on k = 1..(N+1)//2. For each candidate k,
    # we check if any subarray of length 2k-1 meets A[i+j] >= P[j] for all j.
    #
    # Time complexity: O(N log N) which is feasible for N up to 200,000.

    # we'll compare only the first (2k-1) positions. However, building that entire
    # array might be large (up to ~400k). This is still reasonable in memory.
    # Alternatively, we can build the needed pattern each time. We'll do the latter
    # to avoid confusion and ensure correctness.
