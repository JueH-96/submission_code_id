        """
        We need the largest n-digit integer (no leading zero) which is both a palindrome
        and divisible by k (1 <= k <= 9).  We can exploit the fact that k <= 9, which
        means divisibility rules depend on only a small part of the number (last digit,
        last two/three digits, or sum of digits, etc.).

        Strategy by cases for k:

        1) k in {1, 3, 9}:
           - All 9's ("999...999") is automatically divisible by 9 (sum of digits is 9*n),
             and hence also by 3. For k=1 everything is divisible. So answer = '9'*n.

        2) k=2:
           - A number is divisible by 2 iff its last digit is even.
           - For a palindrome, the first digit == last digit and cannot be '0' (leading zero disallowed).
           - The largest even digit under 10 is '8'.  So for n=1, the largest single digit divisible by 2 is '8'.
             For n>1, pick first digit = '8', last digit = '8', and fill the middle with '9's.

        3) k=5:
           - A number is divisible by 5 iff its last digit is 0 or 5.
           - For a palindrome, first digit == last digit and must not be '0', so digit must be '5' for n>1.
           - For n=1, the largest 1-digit multiple of 5 is '5'.
             For n>1, pick first = '5', last = '5', fill the middle with '9's.

        4) k=6 (= 2*3):
           - Must be even (last digit even) AND sum of digits multiple of 3.
           - Start by trying the largest even digit '8' for first/last, fill the rest '9'.
             Sum = 8 + 8 + (n-2)*9 = 16 + 9*(n-2) = 9n - 2
             9n - 2 mod 3 = 1 (since 9n mod 3 = 0). We need to reduce the sum by 1 to be multiple of 3.
             So we can reduce exactly one of the '9's in the middle to '8'.  That lowers sum by 1,
             making it divisible by 3, while preserving a palindrome shape.
           - For n=1, the largest 1-digit multiple of 6 is '6'.

        5) k=4 or k=8:
           - Divisibility by 4 depends on the last two digits; divisibility by 8 on the last three digits.
           - For large n >= 2 (k=4) or n >= 3 (k=8), we only need to ensure the last 2 or 3 digits
             form a multiple of 4 or 8, respectively. Because it is a palindrome, those trailing digits
             mirror the leading digits.
           
           We'll do a small "search" for the leading 2 (or 3) digits that yield a multiple of 4 (or 8)
           when reversed is read as the last 2 (or 3) digits. We pick the largest possible leading block
           that ensures the palindrome is divisible. The rest of the digits in the middle we set to '9'.

           For k=4 and n=1, the largest 1-digit multiple of 4 is '8'.
           For k=8 and n=1, it's '8'.
           For k=4 and n=2, the palindrome is "xx"; we want that 2-digit number to be multiple of 4.
           For k=8 and n=2, same idea (2-digit palindrome "xx" that is multiple of 8).
           For n>=3 and k in {4,8}, we look at the first 2 or 3 digits and pick the largest that works.

        6) k=7:
           - There's no simple one- or two-digit "rule"; 7's divisibility is trickier.
           - We can still do a fallback that tries to adjust from '9'*n downward in a "palindromic" way,
             but for n up to 1e5 that is too big to iterate naÃ¯vely.
           - However, most competitive programming tasks with k=7 typically also allow a constructive hack.
           
           A simple approach that often works in puzzle-like settings is:
           - Start with '9'*n, check mod 7. Let the remainder be r.
           - We need to reduce it by r mod 7. We'll do a small "adjustment" pass from the left side inward:
             try to reduce a digit by enough to fix (remainder) mod 7, mirror the same reduction on the
             right side.  Because k=7 is small, we won't need more than 6 possible downward adjustments
             on a single digit to fix the remainder mod 7. This can be done in O(n) time and yields a
             valid largest palindrome that is divisible by 7 or we move to the next digit if we can't fix
             it in the current digit. One can prove it's always possible to fix the remainder by adjusting
             at most some digits. We'll implement that.

        This covers all k in [1..9].  We'll implement each case carefully.

        #    Because n can be large, we must do this carefully in O(n). We'll keep track of the
