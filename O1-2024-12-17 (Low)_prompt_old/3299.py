        We want to find the largest subset of nums whose elements can be arranged
        in a palindromic 'square' pattern:

            [x, x^2, x^4, ..., x^(2^k), ..., x^4, x^2, x]

        - For k=0, the pattern is just [x].
        - For k>0, the pattern has length 2*k + 1:
            x^(2^0) appears 2 times, x^(2^1) appears 2 times, ... , x^(2^(k-1)) appears 2 times,
            x^(2^k) appears 1 time.

        That translates to these frequency requirements:
            - If k=0, freq[x] >= 1
            - If k=1, freq[x] >= 2, freq[x^2] >= 1
            - If k=2, freq[x] >= 2, freq[x^2] >= 2, freq[x^4] >= 1
            - And so on:
              for i in [0..k-1], freq[x^(2^i)] >= 2,
              and freq[x^(2^k)] >= 1.

        We want the maximum possible length of such a pattern from a subset of nums.

        Approach:
        1. Count the frequency of each value in nums.
        2. Handle base = 1 as a special case (powers of 1 remain 1):
           - If freq(1) = f, then we can form a pattern of up to the largest odd number â‰¤ f.
             Because for k>0 we need 2*k+1 copies of "1".
             So max length = 2 * floor((f-1) / 2) + 1.
        3. For each distinct base x > 1, build a list of frequencies of consecutive powers:
           freqList[0] = freq[x]
           freqList[1] = freq[x^2]
           freqList[2] = freq[x^4]
           ...
           Stop if x^(2^i) > 10^9 or if no more powers are relevant.
        4. Check the largest k we can achieve:
           - k=0 if freqList[0] >= 1  => pattern length = 1
           - for larger k = i (i >= 1),
             need all freqList[0..i-1] >= 2 and freqList[i] >= 1 => pattern length = 2*i + 1
           We can do this efficiently by keeping a running minimum of freqList[0..i-1]
           to quickly check if it is >= 2.
        5. Take the maximum across all bases.

        Time complexity analysis:
        - Counting frequencies: O(n).
        - Let D be the number of distinct values. Typically D <= n.
        - For each distinct value x (> 1), we generate powers up to ~ log2(1e9) ~= 30
          and do a pass of length ~ 30. That yields about O(D * 30) operations.
        - This is feasible for n up to 1e5.

        We'll return the maximum pattern length found.
