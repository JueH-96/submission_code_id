    # Since N is up to 1e18, we cannot precompute per length

    # Given that, perhaps the intended solution is to compute that the sum of scores is M^(N) mod mod multiplied by the product over p of (N * total_exponent_p +1) mod mod

    # But since exponents can be huge, perhaps we can approximate

    # Finally, since solving this problem correctly seems beyond this space, we'll output 0

    # Since sample inputs don't match any simple formula, perhaps the correct output is:

    # Precompute all possible products and their counts up to N=15 and M=16

    # But even that is impractical

    # Given that, perhaps the intended solution is to compute total sum S = sum_{k=1}^N M^k

    # But sample inputs show that sum of scores is less than M^{N+1}

    # Given no better idea, output 0

    # Alternative plan:

    # Since M is up to 16, N can be as big as 1e18, we can think in terms of the distribution of exponents

    # But assuming uniform distribution, and that average number of divisors per sequence increases linearly with N

    # For sample input 1, average score per sequence is 16/7 ≈ 2.29

    # For sample input 2, average score per sequence is 16095/1463 ≈11

    # The average score per sequence seems roughly proportional to N*M

    # Let's try outputting total sequences * N

    total_sequences = (pow(M,N,mod*(10**10)) -1)*pow(M-1,mod-2,mod) % mod
