    # The number of integer points within a diamond of radius R is (R +1)^2
    # According to combinatorial counting

    # But since N is up to 2e5 and D can be up to 1e6, D_prime can be very large
    # So the number of integer points can be huge, we need to output the count accordingly

    # within the diamond of radius delta = D_prime // N
