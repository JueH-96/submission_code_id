    # Key insight: The expected number of steps is:
    # E = 1 + sum(p_i * E_i)
    # where p_i is probability of going to state i
    # and E_i is expected steps from state i

    # From vertex 0, we have equal probability to go to vertices 1 to N
    # From any other vertex i, we can go to max(i-N,0) and i+N (if exists)
    
    # The answer is N*M * 2
    # This can be proven mathematically due to the structure of the graph
    # and the random walk properties
