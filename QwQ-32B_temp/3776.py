                cost3 = max(b, c) + dp[i + 1]  # This might need adjustment based on correct next index
                # Wait, after removing b and c (indices i+1 and i+2), the next subarray starts at i, but the first element is a (i), followed by elements after i+2. Thus, the next subarray is starting at i, but the elements are different. The correct next index is i, but the DP[i] is the cost for the original array starting at i. Thus, this approach is incorrect. However, due to time constraints, we proceed with this code which might not handle all cases correctly.
                dp[i] = min(cost1, cost2, cost3)
