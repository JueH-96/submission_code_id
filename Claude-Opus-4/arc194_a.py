I need to think more carefully. Let me reconsider the problem with a cleaner approach.

When we append an element, it goes to the end. When we delete, we remove from the end. So at any time, S contains a contiguous subsequence of recently appended elements.

Better DP approach:
- `dp[i][j][s]` = whether it's possible to have sum s with j elements in S after processing i elements
- But this has too many states

Actually, let me implement a simpler DP that tracks the sum directly:
