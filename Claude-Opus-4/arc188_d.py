    # such that the lexicographical ordering matches the given constraints.

    # where mask1, mask2, mask3 represent which values have been used in each position

    # The answer depends on:
    # 1. How we assign the unfixed b values
    # 2. How we construct the sequences to achieve the desired ordering
    
    # For the given constraints, we can use the fact that each integer 1-N
    # appears exactly once in each position across all sequences
    
    # The number of valid configurations is the product of:
    # - Ways to assign unfixed b values: unfixed_count!
    # - Ways to construct valid sequences that achieve the ordering

    # of unfixed positions as the base case
