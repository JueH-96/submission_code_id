  def maxPossibleScore(self, start: List[int], d: int) -> int:
    """
    This problem asks for the maximum possible score, where the score is the minimum
    absolute difference between any two chosen integers. Each integer must be chosen
    from a specific interval [start[i], start[i] + d].

    This problem can be modeled as a search problem for the maximum score. The property
    of being able to achieve a certain score is monotonic: if a score `S` is achievable,
    any score `S' < S` is also achievable. This suggests that we can use binary search
    on the score `S`.

    The main challenge is to implement the `can_achieve(S)` function, which determines
    if a given score `S` is possible. To do this, we need to find a set of `n` integers
    `x_0, x_1, ..., x_{n-1}` such that `x_i` is in `[start[i], start[i] + d]` for all `i`,
    and `|x_i - x_j| >= S` for all `i != j`.

    A greedy approach can solve `can_achieve(S)`. Let's sort the chosen numbers as
    `c_0 < c_1 < ... < c_{n-1}`. The condition becomes `c_{k+1} - c_k >= S`.
    The key insight is to decide the order in which we pick numbers from the intervals.
    If we process intervals in a specific order, we can make a greedy choice at each
    step. The most constrained intervals are those that end the earliest. By processing
    these first, we ensure that we can satisfy their constraints while leaving more
    flexible (longer-lasting) intervals for later, larger numbers.

    So, the `can_achieve(S)` algorithm is as follows:
    1. Sort the intervals `[start[i], start[i] + d]` by their end points.
    2. Iterate through the sorted intervals. Let `last_chosen_pos` be the value of the
       last integer we chose. Initialize it to a very small number.
    3. For each interval `[s, e]`, we must choose a number from it. This number must be
       at least `last_chosen_pos + S`. To leave as much room as possible for future
       choices, we should pick the smallest valid number, which is `max(s, last_chosen_pos + S)`.
    4. If this chosen number is greater than `e`, it's impossible to pick a valid number
       from the current interval, so the score `S` is not achievable.
    5. Otherwise, we update `last_chosen_pos` with this newly chosen number and proceed to
       the next interval.
    6. If we successfully find a valid number for every interval, the score `S` is achievable.

    The overall solution structure:
    - Binary search for the answer `S` in a range (e.g., `[0, 2*10^9]`).
    - For each `mid` value in the binary search, call `can_achieve(mid)`.
    - If `can_achieve(mid)` is true, it means we might be able to do better, so we search
      in the upper half `[mid+1, high]`.
    - Otherwise, `mid` is too high, and we search in the lower half `[low, mid-1]`.
