# YOUR CODE HERE
# Read the two strings S and T from a single line of input
S, T = input().split()

# Check if S is equal to "AtCoder" and T is equal to "Land"
# String comparison in Python is case-sensitive, which matches the problem requirement.
if S == "AtCoder" and T == "Land":
    # If both conditions are true, print "Yes"
    print("Yes")
else:
    # Otherwise, print "No"
    print("No")
