    # We'll build a merge tree as described.
    # Indices 1..n are the initial leaves (players).
    # For each match i (1-indexed), we create a new node with id = n + i.
    # That new node has two children:
    #   - left: team that contained player p_i (the first team)
    #   - right: team that contained player q_i (the second team)
    # and we also record the sizes of the two teams (which are fixed regardless of match outcome)
    #
    # Each match gives, for every player in the winning team:
    #   +1 win if that team wins.
    # And the winning probability is:
    #   first team: (a)/(a+b)
    #   second team: (b)/(a+b)
    # Thus, in expectation each player in the first team gets an extra a/(a+b) 
    # and each in the second team gets extra b/(a+b).
    #
    # Since expectation is linear, if we build the merge tree,
    # the expected win for a leaf (player) is the sum over all matches 
    # in whose corresponding merge node the leaf is in the team that gets the win.
    # That is, along the unique tree path from the leaf to the root,
    # at an internal node where the node has two children with sizes L and R,
    # if the leaf is in the left child then add L/(L+R),
    # if it is in the right child then add R/(L+R).
