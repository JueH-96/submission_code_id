    # min-max difference (any set of L elements can be arranged in increasing order 
    # according to their positions in A).
    #
    # Therefore, the strategy is: sort the values in A. In the sorted order, 
    # the tightest L numbers (i.e. consecutive in the sorted order) will yield the 
    # smallest possible difference (max-min).
    #
    # Example: A = (3,1,5,4,9) with K = 2 gives L = 3. Sorting gives (1,3,4,5,9).
    # The best consecutive block of length 3 is (3,4,5) with a difference of 5-3 = 2.
