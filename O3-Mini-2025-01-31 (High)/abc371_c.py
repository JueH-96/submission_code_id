    # Our goal is to choose a series of toggles on H (each toggle on an unordered pair (i,j)
    # costs A[i,j] and flips the bit) so that H becomes isomorphic to G.
    # Two graphs are isomorphic if there is a permutation P (of vertices 0..N-1) such that:
    #   For all 0 <= i < j < N,  G[i][j] == H'( P[i], P[j] )
    # Since toggling an edge is a binary operation (flip or no flip),
    # if for a given pair (i,j) (with i < j in G) the corresponding edge in H (at vertices 
    # (min(P[i],P[j]), max(P[i], P[j])) ) does not match G[i][j], we must pay the cost A
    # for that edge.
