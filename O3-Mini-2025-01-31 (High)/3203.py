        # For each query we will check four “categories” indexed by i in [0, L - 1]:
        #
        # Let the overall palindrome condition require s[i] == s[n-1-i] for all i.
        # In each query we are allowed to rearrange characters in two “allowed” segments:
        # • In the first half: indices in [a, b]
        # • In the second half: indices in [c, d]
        # We define for each i in the first half:
        #    – i is "movable" (allowed) if i is in [a, b] (first‐half allowed region),
        #    – and the mirror index j = n-1-i in the second half is “movable”
        #         if j is in [c, d].
        # It is very convenient to translate the “allowed” status in the second half into a condition on i.
        # Since j = 2L-1 - i, the condition c ≤ j ≤ d becomes
        #      2L-1-d ≤ i ≤ 2L-1-c.
        #
        # So define:
        #    first allowed: [a, b]       (positions in first half you can reorder)
        #    second allowed (mirrored): [r, s_] where r = 2L-1-d and s_ = 2L-1-c.
        #
        # Then, every index i in [0, L-1] falls into one of four categories:
        #   A: Both fixed: i not in [a,b] and i not in [r,s_]. Their characters are not changeable;
        #      so we must already have s[i] == s[n-1-i].
        #   B: i is fixed (i not in [a,b]) but its mirror (i in [r, s_]) is movable.
        #      In the final palindrome, the movable side must be forced to match s[i].
        #   C: i is movable (i in [a, b]) while its mirror is fixed (i not in [r,s_]).
        #      In the final palindrome, that movable position must be forced to equal s[n-1-i].
        #   D: Both side movable: i in [a, b] and i in [r, s_]. Here we have freedom;
        #      but after forcing the forced positions (categories B and C) the leftovers
        #      must be “paired” with matching letters.
        #
        # We will “simulate” the demand/supply in the movable parts using frequency counts.
