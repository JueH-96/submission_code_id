Wait, but the initial approach might not be correct. Let me think again. 

The problem is to reschedule up to k meetings to maximize the longest free time. Rescheduling a meeting can affect the gaps before and after it. For example, moving a meeting earlier or later can merge adjacent gaps. 

The optimal way is to find the k+1 largest gaps after possible merges. However, the solution might involve selecting the k smallest gaps between meetings and merging them into adjacent gaps. 

For instance, in the first example:
- Initial gaps are 1 (0-1), 1 (2-3), and 0 (5-5). So gaps are [1, 1]. Rescheduling one meeting (k=1) merges one gap. The maximum remaining gap is 2 (0-2).

So the approach is to collect all initial gaps, then the answer is the (k+1)th largest gap in the sorted list of gaps. 

So the steps are:
1. Collect all gaps (before first, between meetings, after last).
2. If the number of gaps is â‰¤k, then all gaps can be merged, so the maximum free time is the maximum between the event start to first meeting start (if no meetings), or event end to last meeting end, or any other large gap created by merging all gaps.
3. Otherwise, the answer is the (k+1)th largest gap in the sorted list of gaps.

So the code should:
- Compute all gaps.
- If there are no gaps, return 0.
- If k >= number of gaps, return the maximum possible free time, which is eventTime minus the total duration of all meetings (since all gaps can be merged).
- Otherwise, sort the gaps and the answer is the (k+1)th largest gap, which is gaps_sorted[-(k+1)] if sorted in ascending order.

Wait, no. For example, in the first sample input, gaps are [1, 1]. Sorted, they are [1, 1]. k=1. The (k+1)th largest is the 2nd largest, which is 1. But the answer is 2. So this approach is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the approach is to consider that merging k gaps allows us to have the largest remaining gap. For example, in the first sample, merging the two gaps of 1 each (by moving the first meeting to start at 0 or the second meeting to start at 2) results in a gap of 2.

So perhaps the answer is the sum of the (k+1) smallest gaps plus the largest remaining gap. But that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, the answer is the largest gap after merging k meetings. The largest gap could be the sum of (k+1) adjacent gaps. For example, in the first sample, the two gaps of 1 each are merged into a gap of 2.

So the correct approach is to find the largest window that can be created by merging k meetings. This window would be the sum of (k+1) consecutive gaps in the original list. 

Thus, the solution involves:
1. Collect all the gaps between meetings, including before the first and after the last.
2. The maximum free time after rescheduling k meetings is the maximum sum of (k+1) consecutive gaps in the list of gaps.

For example:
- In sample 1, gaps are [1, 1]. The sum of 2 consecutive gaps is 2. Hence, the answer is 2.
- In sample 2, gaps are [0, 5, 0]. The sum of 2 consecutive gaps is 5 or 5. But the answer is 6. This suggests that the initial approach is not correct.

Wait, sample 2's initial gaps are:
- Before first meeting: 0 (start at 0).
- Between first and second meeting: 2-1 = 1.
- Between second and third meeting: 9-4 =5.
- After last meeting: 10-10=0.
So gaps are [0, 1, 5, 0]. The sum of (k+1=2) consecutive gaps could be 0+1=1, 1+5=6, 5+0=5. The maximum is 6. Which matches the sample output.

So the approach is correct. The solution is to find the maximum sum of (k+1) consecutive gaps in the list of gaps.

Thus, the code should:
1. Compute all gaps.
2. Compute the maximum sum of (k+1) consecutive elements in the gaps array.
3. Return this maximum.

But if k is 0, then the maximum sum is the largest single gap.

So the code can be written as follows:
