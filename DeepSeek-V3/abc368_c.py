        # We can model the attacks as follows:
        # For every 3 attacks, the health decreases by 5
        # So, the number of full groups is h // 5
        # The remaining health is h % 5
        # Then, the number of attacks is 3 * (h // 5) + ceil((h % 5) / 1)
        # But considering that the last attack could be a multiple of 3
        # So, we need to find the minimal T such that the sum of attacks is sufficient
        
        # To find the minimal T, we can simulate the attacks

        # So, for every 3 attacks, the total damage is 5
        # So, the number of full cycles is h // 5
        # The remaining health is h % 5
        # Then, the number of attacks is 3 * (h // 5) + ceil((h % 5) / 1)
        # But we need to consider the starting T
        
        # To find the starting T, we need to know the current T

                attacks += 3
        
        # Now, we need to find the T after these attacks
        # The current T is T + attacks
        # But we need to ensure that the attacks are applied correctly
        # So, we need to simulate the attacks
        
        # To avoid simulation, we can calculate the T after the attacks
        # The T after the attacks is T + attacks
        # But we need to ensure that the attacks are applied in the correct pattern
        
        # Since the pattern is fixed, we can calculate the T after the attacks
        # The T after the attacks is T + attacks
        # But we need to ensure that the attacks are applied in the correct pattern
        
        # So, we can proceed by adding the attacks to T
