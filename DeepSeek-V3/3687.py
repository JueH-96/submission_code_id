Wait, but the above approach might not correctly handle all cases. Let me think again. For example, in the first sample input, the path 0 →1 →4 has length 2+4=6 and 3 nodes. The path 2→5 has length 3+6=9? Wait, no. The edges are 0-1 (2), 1-2 (3), 1-3 (5), 1-4 (4), 2-5 (6). So the path 0→1→4 is 2 (0-1) +4 (1-4) =6. The path 2→5 is 3 (1-2) +6 (2-5) =9? But the sample says both have length 6. So perhaps the path 2→5 is 3 (1-2) is part of the path from 1 to 2, but the path from 2 to 5 is 6. So the path 2→5 is just the edge 2-5, length 6. So the path is from 2 to 5, which is length 6. So the code should consider paths that start at any ancestor and end at a descendant, with unique values.

So the previous approach might not be sufficient. Perhaps we need to perform a post-order DFS, keeping track of the current path's values and lengths.

Let me think of a better approach. For each node, during a DFS, we maintain a dictionary that maps values to the depths (or lengths) at which they were encountered in the current path. As we move down the tree, we check if the current node's value is in the dictionary. If it is, the path up to the previous occurrence of this value is considered. We then proceed to explore the children, updating the dictionary and the current path length.

This approach is similar to finding the longest path with unique values in a tree, which can be handled with a depth-first search and a hash set to track the current path's values.

Here's the revised plan:

1. **Tree Construction**: Build an adjacency list for the tree.
2. **DFS with Path Tracking**: Perform a DFS starting from the root. For each node:
   - Check if the node's value is already in the current path's value set.
   - If it is, the path cannot be extended further. Compare the current path's length with the maximum found so far.
   - If not, add the value to the set, and for each child, recursively proceed, adding the edge length to the current path length.
3. **Tracking Results**: Keep track of the maximum path length encountered and the minimum number of nodes in such paths.

But to handle all possible paths (not just root to leaf), we need to consider paths that start at any ancestor. So during the DFS, whenever we encounter a node, we must check all possible paths ending at that node with unique values.

This suggests that for each node, the path starts at some ancestor where all values from that ancestor to the current node are unique. The length is the sum of the edges along that path.

So, during the DFS, we can maintain a dictionary that maps each value in the current path to the depth (or the cumulative length up to that node). As we process each node, we check if its value is in the dictionary. If it is, we must start a new path from the node after the previous occurrence of the value. Otherwise, we add the value to the dictionary and proceed.

This is similar to the approach used in problems like finding the longest substring with unique characters, but adapted for a tree structure.

Here's the code implementing this approach:
