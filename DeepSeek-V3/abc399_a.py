Wait, but this approach might not handle all cases correctly. Let me think again. The correct approach involves checking if the tree can be split into paths of length K (i.e., K vertices each) such that all vertices are covered exactly once. 

An alternative approach is to note that each path of length K has K-1 edges. The total number of edges in the tree is NK-1. The total edges covered by N paths of K-1 edges each is N*(K-1). So, NK-1 must equal N*(K-1), which simplifies to NK -1 = NK -N → N=1. But this is only true when N=1. Otherwise, the equation is not satisfied. But the sample input 1 has N=3, K=2. NK-1=5, N*(K-1)=3*1=3. 5 !=3. So this suggests that the paths must share edges, but the problem requires that the paths are vertex-disjoint. 

Wait, no. The paths are vertex-disjoint, so each path of K vertices contributes K-1 edges, but the union of all paths must include all vertices. The total number of edges in the tree is NK-1. The paths are vertex-disjoint, so the union of their edges would have N*(K-1) edges. But the tree has NK-1 edges. For N*(K-1) to equal NK-1, we must have NK - N = NK -1 → N=1. So unless N=1, the only way this can happen is if K=1. 

But in the sample input 1, N=3, K=2. The paths are 1-2, 3-4, 5-6. The edges used are 1-2, 3-4, 5-6. The tree's edges are 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 2-5, 5-6. The paths use 3 edges, but the tree has 5 edges. The remaining edges (2-3, 2-5) are not part of the paths. So the paths are vertex-disjoint, but their edges are a subset of the tree's edges. The problem requires that the paths are vertex-disjoint and cover all vertices. 

So the initial approach of checking if the tree can be split into N vertex-disjoint paths, each of K vertices, is the correct problem statement. 

The correct approach is to use a greedy algorithm that tries to split the tree into such paths. The algorithm involves a post-order traversal, where for each node, we attempt to form a path of length K by combining it with its children. If a path of length K is formed, it is added to the list of paths, and the nodes are marked as used. If at any point it's impossible to form such paths, the answer is No.

Here's the correct approach:

1. Perform a post-order traversal of the tree.
2. For each node, after processing its children, check if a path of length K can be formed starting from this node upwards.
3. If a path of length K is formed, mark the nodes as used and proceed.
4. If after processing all nodes, all vertices are used in exactly N paths of length K, output Yes; otherwise, No.

But implementing this requires careful handling. Here's the correct code:
