Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to partition a binary string into the minimum number of beautiful substrings. Let's see what a beautiful substring is. Oh right, each substring must not have leading zeros and must be the binary representation of a power of 5. And if it's impossible, return -1.

Hmm. So first, I need to figure out all possible binary numbers that are powers of 5. Then, for each possible substring in the given string, check if it's a valid power of 5 (without leading zeros) and then find the minimum partitions.

Wait, but how do I generate all the possible binary representations of powers of 5 up to a certain length? Because the input string can be up to 15 characters long. So the maximum possible power of 5 in binary would be a number that, when converted to binary, has up to 15 bits. Let's think: 5^0 is 1 (binary 1), 5^1 is 5 (101), 5^2 is 25 (11001), 5^3 is 125 (1111101), 5^4 is 625 (1001100001), 5^5 is 3125 (110000110101), 5^6 is 15625 (1111001101010001), 5^7 is 78125 (10011000100101101), 5^8 is 390625 (11000000110100000001), 5^9 is 1953125 (1001100001010110010001), 5^10 is 9765625 (100110001001011010000101), 5^11 is 48828125 (100110001001011011000100101), 5^12 is 244140625 (100100011010001000001000101), 5^13 is 1220703125 (1000000010000110100010001010001), 5^14 is 6103515625 (1011000110100110100001001010001), 5^15 is 30517578125 (1100000100010011010001001010001), 5^16 is 152587890625 (1011100010011010110001001010000001), but wait, the binary length here is 18 bits, which is longer than 15. So for a string of length up to 15, the maximum possible power of 5 is 5^14, which is 6103515625, which in binary is 1011000110100110100001001010001 (18 bits?), wait maybe I miscalculated. Let me check.

Wait, maybe I should generate all possible powers of 5, convert them to binary, and collect those binary strings. Then, for each possible substring in the input, check if it's in that set. Also, leading zeros are not allowed, so the binary string must start with '1'.

So the plan is:

1. Precompute all possible binary representations of 5^k where k is a non-negative integer, such that the binary string has length up to 15. Because the input string can be up to 15 characters, any substring longer than that can't be part of the solution. So generate all 5^k, convert to binary without the '0b' prefix, and collect those that are up to 15 bits long. Also, ensure that the binary string does not have leading zeros (which they won't, since 5^k is a positive integer, so binary starts with 1).

Wait, but 5^0 is 1, which is '1' in binary. 5^1 is 5, which is '101'. So all these binary strings start with 1. So leading zeros are not a problem here. So the first step is to generate all possible binary strings of 5^k for k >=0, up to 15 bits. Then, for each possible substring in the input, check if it's in that set.

But how to generate these binary strings? Let's see. For each k starting from 0, compute 5^k, convert to binary, and check the length. If the length is <=15, add to the set. Stop when 5^k's binary length exceeds 15.

So let's compute that. Let's see:

k | 5^k | binary | length
0 | 1 | 1 | 1
1 |5 |101 |3
2 |25 |11001 |5
3 |125 |1111101 |7
4 |625 |1001100001 |10
5 |3125 |110000110101 |12
6 |15625 |1111001101010001 |16 (so this is 16 bits, which is longer than 15. So for k=5, 5^5 is 3125, which is 12 bits. So the maximum k where 5^k's binary is <=15 bits is k=5? Wait 5^5 is 3125, which is 12 bits. 5^6 is 15625, which is 16 bits. So the maximum k is 5. Wait, but 5^5 is 3125, which is 12 bits. So the binary strings for k up to 5 are allowed.
