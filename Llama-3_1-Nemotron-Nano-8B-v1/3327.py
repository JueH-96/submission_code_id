<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the problem statement again. Alice starts at an index and picks up a 1 there (if it's 1), which turns it to 0. Then, she can perform moves to collect more 1s. The moves can be of two types: either flipping a 0 to 1 (but limited by maxChanges) or swapping adjacent 1 and 0 (which turns into 0 and 1, but if the swapped position is the starting index, then she picks up that 1 again). The goal is to collect exactly k ones with the minimum number of moves.

Hmm. So the key is to find the optimal starting position and the sequence of moves that allows Alice to collect k ones in as few steps as possible.

Let me think about the possible scenarios. The initial pick (if the starting index is a 1) counts as a move only if she picks it up. Wait, no: the first action is that she picks up the one at aliceIndex if it's 1. That action doesn't count as a move. Then, each subsequent action (like flipping a 0 to 1, or swapping) counts as a move. But when she swaps and the y is aliceIndex, she picks up that one, which then turns to 0, and that counts as a move. Wait, the problem says: "If y == aliceIndex, Alice picks up the one after this move and nums[y] becomes 0." So the swap action is a move, and if after the swap, the y (which is aliceIndex) is 1, then she picks it up, which turns it to 0. But that action (the swap) is counted as a move. So each swap is a move, and in some cases, that move also results in picking up a 1 (but only if the swap's y is the aliceIndex).

Wait, the problem says: "When the game starts, Alice picks up any index aliceIndex in the range [0, n-1] and stands there. If nums[aliceIndex] == 1, Alice picks up the one and nums[aliceIndex] becomes 0 (this does not count as a move)."

So the initial pick (if it's a 1) is free. Then, each move is either:

1. Flip a 0 to 1 (costs 1 move, but uses one of the maxChanges). But this can be done up to maxChanges times.

2. Swap two adjacent elements x and y where x is 1 and y is 0. After swapping, y becomes 1 and x becomes 0. If y is the aliceIndex, then Alice picks up that 1 (so it's turned to 0 again, but this counts as part of the move). Each swap is a move, and if the swap's y is aliceIndex, then that's a bonus pickup.

So the strategy is to maximize the use of swaps that allow us to collect 1s without using maxChanges, but also considering the initial 1s and the available maxChanges.

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of moves to collect exactly k ones.

Let me think about the possible cases. The initial position gives us 1 if it's a 1. Then, each move can contribute to collecting 1s either by flipping (using maxChanges) or by swapping (which can create a 1 adjacent to the aliceIndex, allowing us to swap again and collect another 1).

But how do these moves contribute to the total count of 1s collected?

Wait, the total number of 1s collected is the sum of:

- The initial 1 (if present at aliceIndex) plus the number of 1s picked up during the moves.

Each time Alice picks up a 1 (either during the initial step or during a swap where y is aliceIndex), that 1 is added to her collection. So the total k is the sum of these.

So the problem is to collect exactly k 1s, using the initial position and the allowed moves.

The challenge is to model this in a way that allows us to compute the minimal moves.

Let me think of the possible steps:

1. The initial step: if the starting index is 1, then that's +1 to the count. So the initial count is 1. Otherwise, 0.

2. Then, for each move, we can either:

a) Flip a 0 to 1 (costs 1 move, uses a maxChange). This adds a 1 to the array, which can be picked up in some way. But how? Because flipping a 0 to 1 gives a new 1, but to collect it, Alice needs to either:

   i) Use a swap to move it to the aliceIndex. For example, if the flipped 0 is adjacent to the aliceIndex, then a swap can be done. But each swap is a move. So for each 0 that is flipped, the cost to collect it might be 1 (the flip) plus the number of swaps needed to bring it to the aliceIndex. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe the flipped 0 can be adjacent to the aliceIndex, allowing a swap to collect it in one move (the flip and the swap would be two moves, but the swap would collect the 1). Wait, no. Let's see: if you flip a 0 to 1 (cost 1 move), then swap it with the aliceIndex (cost 1 move). The swap would turn the aliceIndex (which is 0) into 1, but then Alice picks it up. Wait, no. Let's think:

Suppose aliceIndex is at position A. Initially, after the first step, if it was 1, it's now 0. Then, in a move, you flip a 0 at position B (adjacent to A) to 1. Then, you swap A and B. The swap would set A to 1 and B to 0. But since y (B) is not aliceIndex, so no pickup. Then, in the next move, you can swap again. Hmm, maybe this is not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal way to collect 1s is to have them adjacent to the aliceIndex, so that each swap can collect a 1. For example, if there's a 1 to the left of aliceIndex, you can swap it to the right (if possible) to collect it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to model the problem by considering the positions of the existing 1s and the possible moves to collect them, given the starting position.

Wait, but the problem allows us to flip 0s to 1s (up to maxChanges times) and swap adjacent 1s and 0s. The goal is to collect k 1s in the minimal number of moves.

Let me think of the example given in the problem.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1], k=3, maxChanges=1.

The output is 3. The explanation says that Alice starts at index 1 (which is 1, so she picks it up for free). Then, she uses a flip (maxChanges=1) to set index 2 to 1. Then, she swaps index 2 and 1 (so 1 and 0), which makes index 1 0 and 2 1. But since y is aliceIndex (1), she picks up that 1. Then, she swaps index 0 and 1 (which are 1 and 0), making index 1 1 and 0 0. Again, y is aliceIndex, so she picks up that 1. So total moves: 3 (flip, swap, swap). The initial pickup gives 1, then each move gives 1, so total 3.

So in this case, the initial position is 1, which gives 1. Then, using a flip (cost 1) to create a new 1 adjacent, then swapping to collect it (cost 1), and another swap to collect another (cost 1). So total 3 moves.

So the key here is that each flip allows creating a 1 that can be collected via a swap (if adjacent) in one move. But the flip itself is a move, and the swap is another move. So for each such 1 created via flip, it takes two moves (flip and swap) to collect it. But in the example, the flip is used once, and then two swaps. Wait, maybe the example is using the flip to create a 1 adjacent, then swapping to collect it (which is a move that also picks up the 1). So the flip and swap take two moves, but collect two 1s (the initial one, then the flip's 1 is collected via swap). Wait, no. Let me recheck the example:

Initial nums after starting: [1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]. Wait, no. Wait, the initial nums are [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]. Alice starts at index 1. She picks up the 1 there, so nums becomes [1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]. Then, she uses a flip (move 1) to set index 2 to 1. Now nums is [1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]. Then, she swaps index 2 and 1 (so 1 and 0). After swap, index 1 is 1 and 2 is 0. Since y is aliceIndex (1), she picks up that 1. So this is move 2. Now, the nums becomes [1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1] again? Wait, no. Wait, after the swap, the nums at index 1 is 1 (from the swap), and since she picks it up, it becomes 0. So after this swap, the nums becomes [1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1] (since index 1 is now 0). Then, she swaps index 0 and 1 (1 and 0). After swap, index 1 is 1 and 0 is 0. Since y is aliceIndex (1), she picks it up. So this is move 3. Now, the nums becomes [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]. So she has collected 3 ones (initial, swap 1, swap 2). So each swap after the flip gives a 1. So the flip allows creating a 1 adjacent, which can be swapped into the aliceIndex in one move (the swap), which counts as a move and picks up the 1. So for each such 1 created via flip, it takes two moves (flip and swap) to collect it. But in the example, the flip is used once, and then two swaps. Wait, but the initial pickup gives 1, then the flip (move 1) creates a 1, then swap (move 2) collects it, and another swap (move 3) collects another. So the flip allows creating a 1 that can be collected in two moves (the flip and the swap). But in this case, the flip is used once, and then two swaps. So the total is 3 moves for 3 ones. So the initial 1, then two more via the flip and swaps.

Hmm. So the key is to find a way to collect as many 1s as possible using swaps, which don't cost maxChanges, and use the maxChanges to create new 1s that can be collected via swaps.

So the problem is to model the optimal way to collect k 1s, considering the initial 1 (if present), the available maxChanges, and the positions of existing 1s.

Let me think of the possible approach.

First, the initial position can be any index. So we need to consider all possible starting positions and compute the minimal moves required for each, then choose the minimum among them.

But given that n can be up to 1e5, trying all possible positions is O(n), which is acceptable if each position can be processed in O(1) or O(1) time.

But how to model the minimal moves for a given starting position.

Let's consider a starting position s. Let's say that the initial count is 1 if nums[s] is 1, else 0.

Then, we need to collect (k - initial_count) 1s using the allowed moves.

Each move can be a flip (cost 1, uses maxChanges) or a swap (cost 1, no maxChanges used).

But how do the swaps contribute to collecting 1s?

A swap can be used to move a 1 into the aliceIndex's position. For example, if there's a 1 to the left or right of s, then swapping can bring it to s. But each swap moves the 1 one step closer. For example, if there's a 1 at s+1, then swapping s and s+1 would turn s into 1 and s+1 into 0. But since s is the aliceIndex, after the swap, the 1 is at s, and Alice picks it up. So this swap would cost 1 move and collect 1. So for each 1 that is adjacent to s, we can collect it in 1 move (the swap). For a 1 that is two steps away, we need two swaps (each step) to bring it to s, each swap costing 1 move. So for a 1 at distance d from s, it would take d swaps (each move) to collect it. But each swap can only be done if the 1 is adjacent to the previous position.

But how do we model this? For example, if there are multiple 1s in the array, how to collect them optimally.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to collect as many 1s as possible using swaps (without using maxChanges) and then use the maxChanges to create new 1s where possible.

But how?

Let me think of the steps for a given starting position s:

1. Count the initial 1 (if present). Let's call this initial = 1 if nums[s] is 1, else 0.

2. Then, collect the remaining (k - initial) 1s using swaps and flips.

For swaps:

Each existing 1 in the array (excluding the initial one if it was 1) can be collected via swaps. The number of swaps needed depends on their distance from s.

But how to model this. For example, for each 1 in the array, the minimal number of swaps to bring it to s is the distance between the 1's position and s. But each swap can only move the 1 one step towards s. So for a 1 at position i, the number of swaps needed is |i - s|. But each swap can be done only if the path is clear. Wait, but the problem allows swapping any two adjacent 1 and 0. So for example, if there's a 1 at i and a 0 at i+1, you can swap them. But if there's a 1 at i and a 1 at i+1, you can't swap them (since you can only swap 1 and 0).

Wait, the swap is allowed only when x and y are adjacent, nums[x] is 1, nums[y] is 0. So the swap can only be done when there's a 1 followed by a 0. So the 1 can be moved to the right or left by swapping with adjacent 0s.

But this complicates things. For example, if there's a 1 that is blocked by other 1s, you can't move it towards s. So the presence of other 1s can block the movement of a 1 towards s.

This makes the problem more complex. So the swaps are only possible when there's a 1 and a 0 adjacent. So the 1 can be moved through 0s, but not through 1s.

This suggests that the positions of the 1s in the array (other than the initial one) determine how many can be collected via swaps. For example, if there's a 1 to the left of s, but there's another 1 in between, then that 1 can't be moved to s.

So this complicates the problem. How can we model this efficiently?

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to collect as many 1s as possible using swaps (without using maxChanges) and then use the maxChanges to create new 1s where possible.

But how to model the number of 1s that can be collected via swaps for a given starting position s.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be split into two parts:

1. The number of 1s that can be collected via swaps (without using maxChanges). Let's call this S.

2. The remaining (k - initial - S) 1s must be collected by flipping 0s to 1s (using maxChanges) and then collecting them via swaps. Each such 1 would require a flip (cost 1) and a swap (cost 1) to collect, but only if the flipped 0 is adjacent to s. Otherwise, it may require more swaps.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal moves can be calculated as follows:

For a given starting position s:

- The initial count is 1 if nums[s] is 1.

- Then, the number of 1s that can be collected via swaps (without using maxChanges) is the number of 1s in the array that are in a contiguous block adjacent to s. For example, if s has a 1 to the left, and that 1 is part of a contiguous block of 1s, then each 1 in that block can be collected via swaps. But this is not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the swaps can be used to collect 1s that are in the left and right of s. For example, if there's a 1 to the left of s, and there's a path of 0s between s and that 1, then each swap can move the 1 towards s. But this depends on the arrangement of 1s and 0s.

This seems too vague. Let's think of another approach.

Let me think of the problem in terms of the positions of the 1s in the array. For a given starting position s, the existing 1s can be to the left, right, or both. Let's collect all 1s in the array, and for each, compute the distance to s. But again, the presence of other 1s may block the movement.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of moves for a given s is:

initial (0 or 1) + number of swaps needed to collect existing 1s (each swap is 1 move) + 2 * (number of 1s needed from flips) - but only if the flips are possible (maxChanges is sufficient).

But how to model the swaps for existing 1s.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal way to collect existing 1s is to collect those that are closest to s first, as they require fewer swaps.

But again, the presence of other 1s may block the path.

This is getting complicated. Let's think of the problem in terms of the example.

In example 1, the starting position is 1. The existing 1s are at positions 0,1,5,6,9. After the initial pickup (position 1 becomes 0), the remaining 1s are at 0,5,6,9. Then, the flip is used to create a 1 at position 2. Then, swapping positions 1 and 2 (cost 1 move) collects that 1. Then, swapping positions 0 and 1 (cost 1 move) collects the 1 at 0. So total 3 moves.

But how to model this.

Another example: in example 2, the starting position is 0. The initial nums are all 0s. So initial count is 0. Then, Alice uses two flips (but maxChanges is 3) to create 1s. But each flip requires a swap to collect. So for each flip, she uses one move to flip, then one move to swap into the aliceIndex. So each new 1 costs two moves. But in example 2, the output is 4 moves for two 1s. So each 1 costs two moves. So 2 * 2 =4.

So in this case, the minimal moves are 4.

So the formula here is that for each 1 needed beyond the initial, if it's created via a flip, it takes two moves (flip and swap). But if there are existing 1s that can be collected via swaps, then each such 1 takes one move.

So the problem reduces to:

For a given starting position s:

1. Compute the initial count (0 or 1).

2. Collect as many existing 1s as possible via swaps (each swap is 1 move).

3. The remaining needed 1s (k - initial - collected_swaps) must be created via flips. Each such 1 requires a flip (1 move) and a swap (1 move), but only if the flipped 0 is adjacent to s. Otherwise, perhaps more swaps are needed. But this complicates things.

But how to model the number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the existing 1s can be collected via swaps only if they are in a contiguous block adjacent to s. For example, if there's a 1 to the left of s, and there's a path of 0s between s and that 1, then each swap can move the 1 towards s. But if there are other 1s in between, then the path is blocked.

This seems difficult to model. So perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering that the existing 1s can be collected via swaps only if they are in a contiguous block to the left or right of s, and the path to s is clear of 1s.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the left and right 1s of s.

For example, for a given s:

- The left 1s are the consecutive 1s immediately to the left of s. For example, if s is at position i, and positions i-1, i-2, etc. are 1s, then the left 1s are a contiguous block.

- Similarly for the right 1s.

Each of these 1s can be collected via swaps. For each 1 in the left block, the number of swaps needed is the distance from s. For example, if s is at position i, and there's a 1 at i-1, then one swap. If there's a 1 at i-2, but i-1 is 0, then two swaps (swap i-2 and i-1 to get 0 and 1, then swap i-1 and i to get 1 and 0, then swap i-2 and i-1 again to get 1 and 0, etc. Wait, this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the left and right 1s can be considered as contiguous blocks. For example, the left 1s are the maximum consecutive 1s to the left of s. Similarly for the right. Then, the number of 1s that can be collected via swaps is the sum of the left and right 1s.

But this is not correct. For example, if s is at position i, and there's a 1 at i-2, but i-1 is 0, then you can't collect that 1 via swaps. Because to move the 1 from i-2 to i, you need to swap i-2 and i-1 (which is 0 and 1, so allowed). After swapping, i-1 becomes 1 and i-2 becomes 0. Then, swap i-1 and i (which is 0 and 1). Now, i becomes 1 and i-1 becomes 0. So two swaps to collect the 1 at i-2. So the distance is 2, and the number of swaps is 2.

So for a 1 at distance d from s, the number of swaps needed is d. But each swap requires that the path is clear. For example, if there's a 1 at i-3, and i-2 and i-1 are 0, then you can swap i-3 and i-2 (cost 1), then i-2 and i-1 (cost 1), then i-1 and i (cost 1). So three swaps for a distance of 3.

So the number of swaps needed for a 1 at distance d is d. But this is only possible if the path between the 1 and s is all 0s. If there are 1s in between, then the path is blocked.

This complicates things. So for a given s, the existing 1s that can be collected via swaps are those that are in a contiguous block of 0s leading to s. For example, if there's a 1 at position i-d, and all positions between i-d and s are 0, then it can be collected in d swaps.

But how to find all such 1s for a given s.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering the left and right 1s that are contiguous and adjacent to s.

For example, for s:

- The left 1s are the maximum number of consecutive 1s immediately to the left of s, such that there's a path of 0s from the leftmost 1 to s. Similarly for the right.

But this is not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering that for a given s, the number of 1s that can be collected via swaps is the number of 1s in the left and right directions, but each 1 must be at a distance where the path to s is clear of 1s.

But this seems computationally expensive.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the minimal number of moves for a given s is:

initial + (number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps) + 2 * (remaining needed 1s) - but only if the remaining needed 1s can be covered by maxChanges.

But how to compute the number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the existing 1s can be collected via swaps only if they are in the left or right directions of s, and the path to s is clear. For example, for the left side:

We can look for the maximum number of consecutive 1s to the left of s, such that there's a path of 0s from the leftmost 1 to s. Similarly for the right.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps the left and right 1s can be considered as follows:

For the left side:

We start at s-1 and move left as long as the current position is 1 and the next position (to the left) is 0. Wait, no. For example, if s is at position i, and i-1 is 1, i-2 is 0, then the left 1s can be collected. But if i-1 is 1, i-2 is 1, then the path is blocked.

Alternatively, perhaps the left 1s are the number of consecutive 1s starting from s-1 and moving left, but only if there's a path of 0s leading to s. For example, if s is at i, and i-1 is 1, i-2 is 0, then the left 1 can be collected in 1 swap. If i-1 is 1, i-2 is 1, then the left 1s are 2, but the path is blocked. So this approach may not work.

This is getting too complicated. Let's think of another approach.

Perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering that the minimal number of moves for a given s is:

initial + (number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps) + 2 * (max(0, k - initial - existing_swaps) - flips_available) + ... ?

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two parts:

1. Collect as many existing 1s as possible using swaps. Each such 1 requires 1 move.

2. For the remaining needed 1s, use flips (each requiring 1 move) and swaps (each requiring 1 move) to collect them. So each such 1 requires 2 moves.

But how to compute the number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the existing 1s can be collected via swaps only if they are in the left or right directions of s, and the path to s is clear. For example, for the left side:

We can collect all 1s to the left of s that are in a contiguous block, and the path to s is clear of 1s. Similarly for the right.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering that the existing 1s can be collected via swaps only if they are in the left or right directions of s, and the path to s is clear. For example, for the left side:

We can collect all 1s to the left of s that are in a contiguous block, and the path to s is all 0s. So for example, if s is at position i, and there's a 1 at i-1, then it can be collected in 1 swap. If there's a 1 at i-2, but i-1 is 0, then it can be collected in 2 swaps (swap i-2 and i-1, then swap i-1 and i). So the number of swaps is the distance between the 1 and s.

So for each 1 to the left of s, the number of swaps needed is the distance from s. Similarly for the right.

But how to find all such 1s.

This suggests that for a given s, the number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps is the sum of the number of 1s to the left and right of s, each multiplied by their distance from s. But this is not correct, as the 1s may be blocked by other 1s.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering that the existing 1s can be collected via swaps only if they are in a contiguous block to the left or right of s, and the path to s is clear. For example, the left 1s are the maximum number of consecutive 1s to the left of s, such that there's a path of 0s from the leftmost 1 to s. Similarly for the right.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by precomputing for each position s the number of 1s that can be collected via swaps. For example, for each s, compute the number of 1s to the left and right that can be collected via swaps, and sum them.

But how.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering that the existing 1s can be collected via swaps only if they are in the left or right directions of s, and the path to s is clear. For example, for the left side:

We can collect all 1s to the left of s that are in a contiguous block, and the path to s is all 0s. So for example, if s is at position i, and there's a 1 at i-1, then it can be collected in 1 swap. If there's a 1 at i-2, but i-1 is 0, then it can be collected in 2 swaps. But if i-1 is 1, then the path is blocked.

This seems to require checking each 1 to the left and right of s, and for each, determine the distance and whether the path is clear.

But this would be O(n) per s, which is not feasible for n=1e5.

So this approach is not feasible.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem requires a different approach.

Let me think of the problem in terms of the minimal moves required.

The minimal moves would be achieved by:

- Collecting as many existing 1s as possible via swaps (each requiring 1 move).

- Using the maxChanges to create new 1s and collect them via swaps (each requiring 2 moves: flip and swap).

So the formula for the minimal moves for a given s is:

moves = initial + swaps_count + 2 * flips_needed

where swaps_count is the number of existing 1s collected via swaps, and flips_needed is the number of 1s needed after using swaps.

But how to compute swaps_count.

Alternatively, swaps_count is the number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps, which depends on their positions relative to s.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering that the existing 1s can be collected via swaps only if they are in the left or right directions of s, and the path to s is clear. For example, for the left side:

The left 1s are the number of consecutive 1s starting from s-1 and moving left, but only if there's a path of 0s leading to s. For example, if s is at i, and i-1 is 1, i-2 is 0, then the left 1 can be collected in 1 swap. If i-1 is 1, i-2 is 1, then the left 1s are 2, but the path is blocked. So this approach may not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the left 1s are the maximum number of consecutive 1s to the left of s, such that there's a path of 0s from the leftmost 1 to s. For example, if s is at i, and there's a 1 at i-1, i-2 is 0, then the left 1 can be collected. If i-1 is 1, i-2 is 1, then the left 1s are 2, but the path is blocked. So this approach is not correct.

This is getting too stuck. Let's think of another way.

Perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering that the minimal moves for a given s is:

initial + (number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps) + 2 * (max(0, k - initial - existing_swaps) - available_max_changes)

But this is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering that the minimal moves is the sum of:

- The initial 1 (if present).

- The number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps (each 1 requires 1 move).

- The number of 1s needed beyond that, multiplied by 2 (each requires a flip and a swap).

But how to compute the number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the existing 1s can be collected via swaps only if they are in the left or right directions of s, and the path to s is clear. For example, for the left side:

We can collect all 1s to the left of s that are in a contiguous block, and the path to s is all 0s. So for each such 1, the number of swaps needed is the distance from s.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering that the existing 1s can be collected via swaps only if they are in the left or right directions of s, and the path to s is clear. For example, for the left side:

We can collect all 1s to the left of s that are in a contiguous block, and the path to s is all 0s. So for example, if s is at position i, and there's a 1 at i-1, then it can be collected in 1 swap. If there's a 1 at i-2, but i-1 is 0, then it can be collected in 2 swaps. But if i-1 is 1, then the path is blocked.

So for the left side, the number of 1s that can be collected via swaps is the number of consecutive 1s starting from s-1 and moving left, but only if there's a path of 0s leading to s.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by precomputing for each position i the maximum number of 1s that can be collected via swaps to the left and right.

But this would require O(n) time and space.

Let me think of how to compute this.

For each position i:

- The left_ones[i] is the number of consecutive 1s to the left of i, such that there's a path of 0s from the leftmost 1 to i.

Wait, but this is not clear. For example, if i is at position 5, and the left has 1s at 3,4, but 4 is 0, then the path is blocked.

Alternatively, perhaps left_ones[i] is the maximum number of consecutive 1s to the left of i, such that there's a path of 0s from the leftmost 1 to i.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps for each position i, we can precompute the maximum number of 1s to the left that can be collected via swaps. For example:

left_ones[i] is the maximum number of consecutive 1s to the left of i, such that between the leftmost 1 and i, all are 0s.

But this is not correct. For example, if i is at position 5, and the left has 1s at 3,4, but 4 is 0, then the path is blocked.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the problem requires a different approach.

Let me think of the problem in terms of the following steps:

For each possible starting position s:

1. Compute the initial count (0 or 1).

2. Compute the number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps. Let's call this S.

3. The remaining needed is R = max(0, k - initial - S).

4. If R <= 0, then the total moves are initial + S.

5. Else, we need to collect R 1s via flips and swaps. Each such 1 requires a flip (cost 1) and a swap (cost 1), but only if the flipped 0 is adjacent to s. Otherwise, it may require more swaps.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, perhaps each flipped 0 must be adjacent to s to be collected in two moves. Otherwise, it may require more moves. But this is not specified in the problem statement.

But according to the examples, it's possible to collect a flipped 0 by swapping it into s's position. For example, in example 2, the flipped 0 is adjacent to s (0), so the swap can collect it in one move. But if the flipped 0 is not adjacent, then it would require more swaps.

But this complicates the problem. So perhaps the minimal moves for the remaining R 1s is 2 * R, but only if the maxChanges is sufficient (maxChanges >= R). Otherwise, it's impossible (but the problem states that maxChanges + sum(nums) >= k, so it's possible).

But how to model this.

So for a given s:

moves = initial + S + 2 * R

where R = max(0, k - initial - S)

But this is only possible if the maxChanges >= R. Because each R requires a flip (using maxChanges).

But the problem states that maxChanges + sum(nums) >= k. So sum(nums) is the initial 1s plus the existing 1s. But this is not clear.

Wait, sum(nums) is the initial number of 1s in the array. The initial count is 1 if s is 1. So sum(nums) is the total number of 1s in the array. But when Alice starts, she picks up the 1 at s (if present), which reduces the sum by 1. Then, during the moves, she can flip 0s to 1s (up to maxChanges times) and swap 1s and 0s.

But the problem requires that the total number of 1s collected is exactly k. So the sum of the initial 1 (if present) plus the number of 1s collected via swaps and flips must be k.

But the sum of the initial 1s in the array is sum(nums). But after the initial step, the sum is sum(nums) - 1 (if initial is 1) or sum(nums) (if initial is 0). Then, during the moves, each flip increases the sum by 1 (flip 0 to 1), and each swap doesn't change the sum (swap 1 and 0, sum remains the same). So the total sum after all moves is sum_initial - initial + flips.

But the total 1s collected is initial (0 or 1) + swaps_count + flips.

So the equation is:

initial + swaps_count + flips = k

But flips can't exceed maxChanges.

So for a given s:

We need to find swaps_count and flips such that:

swaps_count + flips = k - initial

and flips <= maxChanges.

The minimal moves is initial + swaps_count + 2 * flips.

Because each swap is 1 move, each flip is 1 move, and each flip requires a swap (1 move) to collect the 1. So for each flip, it's 2 moves (flip and swap).

Wait, no. For each flip, you need to flip a 0 to 1 (1 move), then swap it into the aliceIndex (1 move). So each flip contributes 2 moves and collects 1 1.

So the total moves for flips is 2 * flips.

But the swaps_count is the number of existing 1s collected via swaps (each 1 requires 1 move).

So the total moves is initial (0 or 1) + swaps_count + 2 * flips.

But we need to maximize swaps_count to minimize the total moves.

So the problem reduces to, for each s:

Compute the maximum possible swaps_count (existing 1s that can be collected via swaps), then compute flips = max(0, k - initial - swaps_count). If flips > maxChanges, then it's not possible (but the problem states that it's possible). So the minimal moves is initial + swaps_count + 2 * flips.

But how to compute swaps_count for a given s.

This is the crux of the problem.

So the key is to find, for each s, the maximum number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps.

But how.

Let me think of the following approach:

For a given s, the existing 1s can be collected via swaps only if they are in the left or right directions of s, and the path to s is clear of 1s. For example, for the left side:

We can collect all 1s to the left of s that are in a contiguous block, and the path to s is all 0s. For each such 1, the number of swaps needed is the distance from s.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps is the sum of the number of 1s to the left and right of s, each multiplied by their distance from s, but this is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps is the sum of the number of 1s to the left of s (each at distance d) and to the right (each at distance d), but only if the path to s is clear.

But this is not feasible to compute for large n.

So perhaps the problem requires a different approach.

Let me think of the problem in terms of the following:

The minimal moves for a given s is:

initial + (number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps) + 2 * (k - initial - existing_swaps) 

But this is only possible if the maxChanges is >= (k - initial - existing_swaps).

But how to compute existing_swaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the existing_swaps is the number of 1s in the array that are in the left and right directions of s, and can be collected via swaps.

But how.

Alternatively, perhaps the existing_swaps is the number of 1s in the array that are in the left and right directions of s, and the path to s is clear.

But again, how to compute this.

This is getting too stuck. Let's think of the problem from another angle.

The problem requires us to find the minimal moves to collect k 1s, given the initial position s. The moves can be:

- Swap existing 1s into s's position (each swap is 1 move).

- Flip 0s to 1s (each flip is 1 move) and then swap them into s's position (each such 1 requires 2 moves).

So the minimal moves is the initial count (0 or 1) plus the number of swaps for existing 1s plus 2 * the number of flips.

To minimize the moves, we need to maximize the number of existing 1s collected via swaps.

So for each s, the existing_swaps is the maximum number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps.

But how to compute this.

Let me think of the following approach:

For a given s, the existing_swaps is the number of 1s in the array that are in the left and right directions of s, and can be collected via swaps. For each such 1, the number of swaps needed is the distance from s.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps the existing_swaps is the sum of the number of 1s to the left of s (each at distance d) and to the right (each at distance d), but only if the path to s is clear.

But this is not feasible to compute for large n.

So perhaps the problem requires a different approach.

Let me think of the following:

The minimal moves for a given s is:

initial + (number of existing 1s in the array) + 2 * (k - initial - existing_1s) 

But this is only if the existing_1s are all collected via swaps. But this is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering that the existing 1s can be collected via swaps, but each swap requires one move. So the minimal moves is initial + existing_1s + 2 * (k - initial - existing_1s) 

But this is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering that the minimal moves is:

initial + (k - initial) * 2 

But this is only if all the k - initial 1s are created via flips. But this would be the case when there are no existing 1s to collect via swaps.

But this is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering that the minimal moves is the sum of:

- initial (0 or 1)

- the number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps (each 1 requires 1 move)

- 2 * (k - initial - existing_swaps) 

But how to compute existing_swaps.

This is the crux of the problem.

Let me think of the following approach:

For each possible starting position s:

1. Compute the initial count (0 or 1).

2. Compute the number of existing 1s in the array. Let's call this total_ones.

3. The maximum possible existing_swaps is the minimum between (total_ones - initial) and (k - initial), but this is not correct.

Alternatively, the existing_swaps is the number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps, which depends on their positions relative to s.

But how.

Alternatively, perhaps the existing_swaps is the number of existing 1s that are in the left and right directions of s, and can be collected via swaps. For example, for the left side:

We can collect all 1s to the left of s that are in a contiguous block, and the path to s is all 0s. For each such 1, the number of swaps needed is the distance from s.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps the existing_swaps is the sum of the number of 1s to the left of s (each at distance d) and to the right (each at distance d), but this is not feasible.

This is getting too stuck. Let's think of the problem in terms of the examples.

In example 1:

nums = [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1], k=3, maxChanges=1.

The starting position is 1. The initial count is 1.

The existing_1s are 5 (positions 0,1,5,6,9). After initial pickup, the remaining 1s are 4.

But how many of them can be collected via swaps.

In the example, after the initial pickup, the 1 at position 0 can be collected via two swaps (swap 0 and 1, then swap 1 and 0). But in the example, the swap is done in a different way.

But according to the example, the existing_swaps for s=1 is 2 (the 1 at position 0 and the one created via flip). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the existing_swaps for s=1 is 2 (the 1 at position 0 and the one at position 5 and 6, but they are not collected via swaps).

This is not helpful.

Perhaps the problem requires a different approach. Let's think of the following:

The minimal moves for a given s is:

initial + (number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps) + 2 * (k - initial - existing_swaps)

But to compute existing_swaps, we need to find the maximum number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps.

But how.

Alternatively, perhaps the existing_swaps is the number of existing 1s that are in the left and right directions of s, and can be collected via swaps. For example, for the left side:

We can collect all 1s to the left of s that are in a contiguous block, and the path to s is all 0s. For each such 1, the number of swaps needed is the distance from s.

But how to compute this.

Let me think of the following code structure:

For each possible s in 0..n-1:

   initial = 1 if nums[s] == 1 else 0

   if initial >= k:

       return 0

   # collect existing 1s via swaps

   left = 0

   i = s-1

   while i >=0 and nums[i] == 1:

       left +=1

       i -=1

   right =0

   i = s+1

   while i <n and nums[i] ==1:

       right +=1

       i +=1

   existing_swaps = left + right

   needed = k - initial - existing_swaps

   if needed <=0:

       moves = initial + existing_swaps

   else:

       if maxChanges >= needed:

           moves = initial + existing_swaps + 2 * needed

       else:

           # not possible, but problem says it is

           # so this case won't happen

   # but this is not correct, because the existing_swaps may not be collectible via swaps.

   # for example, if the 1s are not contiguous.

   # So this approach is incorrect.

But according to this code, for example 1:

s=1:

initial=1

left: i=0, nums[0] is 1. So left=1. Then i becomes -1.

right: i=2, nums[2] is 0. So right=0.

existing_swaps = 1+0=1.

needed = 3-1-1=1.

maxChanges=1.

moves=1+1 + 2*1=4. But the example's answer is 3. So this approach is incorrect.

So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. So the problem is that the existing_swaps is not correctly computed.

In example 1, the existing_swaps should be 2 (the 1 at position 0 and the one at position 5 and 6, but they are not collected via swaps). But according to the code, existing_swaps is 1.

So the code is not correct.

So the approach of counting the number of consecutive 1s to the left and right is not correct.

This suggests that the problem requires a different approach.

Let me think of the following:

The existing_swaps is the number of 1s that can be collected via swaps, which depends on their distance from s and the path to s.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps the existing_swaps is the sum of the number of 1s to the left of s (each at distance d) and to the right (each at distance d), but only if the path to s is clear.

So perhaps the problem requires a different approach.

Let me think of the following:

The minimal moves is the sum of:

- initial (0 or 1)

- the number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps (each 1 requires 1 move)

But the existing_swaps is the maximum number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps.

Perhaps the problem can be solved by considering that the minimal moves is the sum of the initial 1, the number of existing 1s that can be collected via swaps (each requiring 1 move), and the remaining 1s collected via flips and swaps (each requiring 2 moves).

But how to compute the existing_swaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the existing_swaps is the number of existing 1s that are in the left and right directions of s, and can be collected via swaps. For example, for the left side:

We can collect all 1s to the left of s that are in a contiguous block, and the path to s is all 0s. For each such 1, the number of swaps needed is the distance from s.

Alternatively, perhaps the existing_swaps is the number of existing 1s that are in the left and right directions of s, and can be collected via swaps. For example, for the left side:

We can collect all 1s to the left of s that are in a contiguous block, and the path to s is all 0s. For each such 1, the number of swaps needed is the distance from s.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps the existing_swaps is the sum of the number of 1s to the left of s (each at distance d) and to the right (each at distance d), but this is not correct.

This is not helpful.

At this point, I think I need to look for a different approach.
