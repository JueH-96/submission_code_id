Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find the number of subsequences of size 5 where the middle element (the third one, index 2 in 0-based) is the unique mode. And since the answer can be big, we need to return it modulo 1e9+7. 

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is here. Oh right, a subsequence is any sequence that can be derived by deleting some or no elements without changing the order. So the order of elements in the original array must be preserved, but we can skip elements in between. 

The key part is that the middle element of the 5-length subsequence must be the unique mode. So, in the subsequence of 5 elements, the third element must appear more times than any other element. And there should be no other element with the same maximum frequency. 

Let me think about the example given. In example 1, all elements are 1. So any 5-length subsequence will have all 1s. The middle element is 1, which is the mode (appears 5 times), and it's unique. The number of such subsequences is the number of ways to choose 5 elements from 6, which is C(6,5) =6. That makes sense.

In example 2, the input is [1,2,2,3,3,4]. The valid subsequences are [1,2,2,3,4] and [1,2,3,3,4]. Let's see why. For the first one, the middle element is 2. The counts are 1 (1), 2 (2), 1 (3), 1 (4). So 2 is the mode. For the second, the middle is 3, which also has count 2. But wait, in the second subsequence, the elements are 1,2,3,3,4. The counts are 1,1,2,1. So 3 is the mode. So both of these have a unique mode in the middle. The other possible 5-length subsequences might not meet the criteria. For example, [2,2,3,3,4] would have middle element 3. The counts are 2 (2), 2 (3), 1 (4). So the modes are 2 and 3, which are not unique. Hence, that's invalid.

So the approach is to consider all possible 5-length subsequences where the third element is the unique mode. 

But how do we efficiently compute this? Because the array can be up to 1000 elements, the total number of possible 5-length subsequences is C(1000,5) which is way too big (about 10^13). So a brute-force approach of checking every possible subsequence is impossible. We need a smarter way.

Hmm. Let's think about the structure of a valid subsequence. The middle element (third position) must be the mode, and it must be unique. So, in the subsequence, the middle element's count must be higher than all other elements. Since the subsequence is of length 5, the possible counts for the middle element can be 3, 4, or 5. Because if the middle element appears 3 times, then the other two elements can be different, each appearing once. If it appears 4 times, then one other element appears once. If it appears 5 times, all are the same. 

Wait, but the middle element is part of the subsequence. So for example, if the middle element is x, then in the subsequence, x must appear at least once (since it's the middle element). To be the unique mode, x's count must be strictly greater than the count of any other element in the subsequence. 

So possible scenarios for the counts in the subsequence:

Case 1: x appears 3 times. Then the other two elements must each appear once. Because if any other element appears twice, then x's count (3) is higher than that (2), but if another element also appears twice, then x is still the mode. Wait, no. Wait, the mode is the element with the maximum frequency. So if x appears 3 times, and another element appears 2 times, then x is the mode. But if there are two elements that each appear 2 times, then the mode is not unique. So in this case, the subsequence's mode is x only if x's count is strictly greater than all others. So for x to be the unique mode, in the subsequence, x's count must be higher than the count of any other element. 

So possible scenarios:

- x appears 3 times, others appear once each. Then x is the mode (3 times), others are 1. So unique.

- x appears 3 times, one other element appears 2 times. Then x's count is 3, which is higher than 2. So x is the mode. But wait, in this case, the other element's count is 2. So x is the mode. But if there are two elements with 2 counts, then x's count is 3, which is higher. So in that case, x is the mode. Wait, but in a 5-length subsequence, if x is 3 times, then the other two elements can be two different elements (each once) or one element twice. 

Wait, let's see. For example, x appears 3 times, and another element y appears 2 times. Then the counts are x:3, y:2. So x is the mode. So that's allowed. But in that case, the subsequence would have x as the mode. So the middle element is x, and the counts are 3 and 2. So x is the unique mode. So that's a valid case. 

Wait, but in the example given in example 2, the valid subsequences have the middle element as 2 and 3, each with count 2. Wait, no. Let me check example 2 again. 

In example 2, the input is [1,2,2,3,3,4]. The output is 4. The explanation says that [1,2,2,3,4] and [1,2,3,3,4] are valid. Let's look at the first one. The elements are 1,2,2,3,4. The middle element is 2. The counts are 1 (1), 2 (2), 1 (3), 1 (4). So 2 is the mode. So in this case, the middle element is 2, which appears twice. Wait, but the subsequence is of length 5. So 2 appears twice. Then how is that possible? Because the middle element is part of the subsequence. So in this case, the middle element is 2, which is part of the two 2's. So the counts for 2 in the subsequence is 2. Then how is that the mode? Because the other elements have counts 1. So 2 is the mode. But the problem states that the middle element must be the unique mode. So in this case, the middle element is 2, which is the mode. But the count is 2. So the other elements have counts 1. So 2 is the mode. So this is a valid case. 

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the mode is the element that appears the maximum number of times. So in this case, 2 appears twice, others once. So 2 is the mode. So the subsequence is valid. 

So the middle element's count can be 2, but only if all other elements have counts less than 2. Wait, but in this example, the middle element's count is 2, and others are 1. So that's allowed. 

So the possible counts for the middle element (x) can be 2, 3, 4, or 5. Wait, but in a 5-length subsequence, the maximum possible count for x is 5 (all elements are x). So the possible counts for x are 2,3,4,5. But how?

Wait, let's think again. For x to be the unique mode, its count must be strictly greater than the count of any other element in the subsequence. 

So, for example, if x appears 2 times, then all other elements in the subsequence must appear once. Because if any other element appears 2 times, then x's count is equal to that, so there's a tie for the mode. So in that case, the mode is not unique. 

So the possible scenarios are:

1. x appears 3 times. Then the other two elements can be either two different elements (each once) or one element twice. Wait, no. Because if x is 3 times, and another element is 2 times, then x's count is higher. So that's allowed. Wait, but in a 5-length subsequence, if x is 3 times, then the other two elements can be two different elements (each once) or one element twice. For example, x, x, x, y, y. Then x's count is 3, y's is 2. So x is the mode. So that's allowed. 

Wait, but in that case, the middle element is x (third position). So the subsequence would be x, x, x, y, y. Then the counts are x:3, y:2. So x is the mode. So that's a valid case. 

So the possible counts for x (the middle element) can be 2, 3, 4, or 5. But each case must satisfy that x's count is strictly greater than the count of any other element in the subsequence. 

So let's break down the possible cases:

Case 1: x appears 5 times. Then all elements are x. So the mode is x, unique. So this is valid. The number of such subsequences is the number of ways to choose 5 x's from the array, but since all elements in the subsequence are x, the middle element is x. So for this case, we need to count all 5-length subsequences consisting of x's. 

Case 2: x appears 4 times. Then the fifth element is a different number. So in the subsequence, there are four x's and one other element. The other element can be any element not equal to x. The mode is x (4 times), which is unique. So this is valid. 

Case 3: x appears 3 times. Then the other two elements can be either:

a) Two different elements, each appearing once. So the counts are x:3, others:1. So x is the mode. 

b) One element appearing twice. So x:3, y:2. Then x is the mode. 

But in this case, the other element (y) can't appear more than once. Wait, no. If x is 3 times, and y is 2 times, then x is the mode. So that's allowed. 

Case 4: x appears 2 times. Then the other three elements must all be distinct. Because if any other element appears twice, then x's count is equal to that, leading to a tie. So in this case, the other three elements must each appear once. So the counts are x:2, others:1. So x is the mode. 

Wait, but in this case, the middle element is x. So the subsequence would have x in the third position, and x appears twice. The other three elements are distinct. So x's count is 2, others 1. So x is the mode. 

So these are the four possible cases where x is the unique mode. 

So the approach is to iterate over all possible middle elements (each element in the array can be the middle element of some subsequence), and for each possible x (the middle element), count the number of 5-length subsequences where x is the middle element, and x is the unique mode. 

But how to compute this efficiently?

Let's think for each x in the array. For each occurrence of x in the array (since the middle element is a specific occurrence of x in the array), we can consider it as the middle element. Then, we need to count the number of ways to choose two elements before it (to form the first two elements of the subsequence) and two elements after it (to form the last two elements of the subsequence), such that in the entire subsequence, x is the unique mode. 

But this seems complicated. Because the elements before and after can include x's and other elements. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the positions of x in the array. For each x at position i (0-based), which is the middle element of a 5-length subsequence, we need to count the number of ways to choose two elements before i and two elements after i, such that in the combined subsequence (the two before, x, two after), x is the unique mode. 

But even this approach may be computationally intensive, as for each x in the array, we have to consider all possible pairs before and after. 

Wait, but the array can be up to 1000 elements. For each x in the array (up to 1000 elements), and for each occurrence of x (could be multiple), we need to process. So perhaps this approach is feasible. 

But how to model the counts of x and other elements in the subsequence. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each possible x, the number of x's in the array, and their positions. Then, for each possible x, and for each possible occurrence of x as the middle element, compute the number of valid left and right pairs. 

But even that might be tricky. Let's think step by step. 

Let's first consider that the middle element is x. So the subsequence is [a, b, x, d, e], where a and b are elements before x in the array, and d and e are elements after x. 

Wait, no. Because the subsequence is formed by selecting elements in order. So the middle element (third position) must be x, which is at some position in the array. The two elements before x in the subsequence can be any elements that come before x in the array. Similarly, the two elements after can be any elements that come after x in the array. 

But the elements in the subsequence can be from any positions, as long as their order is preserved. So for example, the two elements before x in the subsequence can be any two elements from the array that are before x's position. Similarly for the two after. 

But the problem is that the elements in the subsequence can include other x's. So the count of x in the subsequence is 1 (the middle element) plus the number of x's in the two before and two after. 

So for example, if the middle element is x at position i, and there are k x's before i and m x's after i, then the total x's in the subsequence is 1 + k (from the two before) + m (from the two after). Wait, no. Because the two before can include x's. For example, if the two before are x and x, then the subsequence has x, x, x, d, e. So the count of x is 3. 

So the total x's in the subsequence is 1 (middle) + the number of x's in the two before elements + the number of x's in the two after elements. 

So for the subsequence to have x as the unique mode, the total x's in the subsequence must be greater than the count of any other element in the subsequence. 

But how to model this. 

Let me think of the variables involved. For a given x (the middle element) at position i:

- The two elements before i (positions j and k, j < k < i) can be any two elements from the array before i. 

- The two elements after i (positions l and m, i < l < m) can be any two elements from the array after i. 

The subsequence is [a, b, x, d, e], where a and b are elements from before i, d and e from after. 

The count of x in the subsequence is 1 (the middle) plus the number of x's in a and b (since they are before i) plus the number of x's in d and e (since they are after i). 

Wait, no. Because a and b are elements from the array before i. So if a is x, then that's part of the count. Similarly for b. Similarly, d and e can be x's. 

So the total x's in the subsequence is 1 (middle) + count of x in a and b (the two before) + count of x in d and e (the two after). 

But the other elements in the subsequence (a, b, d, e) can be any elements, including x. 

So the problem is to count all possible combinations of a, b (from before i) and d, e (from after i) such that:

x_count = 1 + (number of x's in a and b) + (number of x's in d and e) 

and for all other elements y in the subsequence (excluding x), their count in the subsequence is less than x_count. 

But this seems very complex. How can we model this efficiently?

Alternative approach: For each possible x (the middle element), and for each occurrence of x in the array (as the middle element), compute the number of valid left and right pairs (a, b) and (d, e) such that the total x's in the subsequence (1 + left_x + right_x) is greater than the maximum count of any other element in the subsequence. 

But even this seems challenging. 

Let's think of the possible x counts in the subsequence. For x to be the unique mode, the x_count must be greater than the count of any other element in the subsequence. 

Let's denote the x_count as t. Then, for all other elements y in the subsequence, their count in the subsequence must be < t. 

The x_count is t = 1 + left_x + right_x, where left_x is the number of x's in the two before elements (a and b), and right_x is the number of x's in the two after elements (d and e). 

The other elements in the subsequence are a, b, d, e. So for each of these elements (excluding x), their count in the subsequence is the number of times they appear in a, b, d, e. 

But this is getting complicated. 

Alternative idea: For each x (middle element), and for each possible t (the x_count in the subsequence), compute the number of left and right pairs that result in x_count = t, and ensure that all other elements in the subsequence have counts less than t. 

But how to model this. 

Let's consider each possible x (middle element) and its position i. 

For the left part (a and b), we can choose any two elements from the elements before i. Let's denote the left elements as L. Similarly, the right elements (d and e) are from elements after i, denoted as R. 

The x_count is 1 + (number of x's in L) + (number of x's in R). 

The other elements in the subsequence are the elements in L and R, except x. 

For each of these elements y (y != x), their count in the subsequence is the number of times they appear in L and R. 

So for the subsequence to be valid, for all y != x, count(y) < x_count. 

But how to compute this. 

Alternative approach: For each x (middle element) at position i, precompute the counts of x in the left (elements before i) and right (elements after i). 

Then, for the left part (a and b), the number of x's in them can be 0, 1, or 2. Similarly for the right part (d and e). 

So the x_count can be 1 + l_x + r_x, where l_x is the number of x's in the left two elements, and r_x is the number of x's in the right two elements. 

The possible values for l_x and r_x are 0, 1, 2. 

So for each possible combination of l_x and r_x (0<=l_x <=2, 0<=r_x <=2), the x_count is 1 + l_x + r_x. 

Then, for each such combination, we need to compute the number of left pairs (a, b) that have exactly l_x x's, and the number of right pairs (d, e) that have exactly r_x x's. 

But even this is not enough, because the other elements in the subsequence (the non-x elements in L and R) must have counts less than x_count. 

So for each combination of l_x and r_x, we need to compute the number of left and right pairs such that:

- The left pair has exactly l_x x's. 

- The right pair has exactly r_x x's. 

- For all elements y in the left and right pairs (excluding x), the count of y in the entire subsequence (left pair + right pair) is less than x_count. 

This seems very complex. 

Alternative idea: For each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible l_x and r_x, compute the number of left pairs with l_x x's and the number of right pairs with r_x x's, and then check if the maximum count of any other element in the left and right pairs is less than x_count. 

But how to compute the maximum count of other elements in the left and right pairs. 

Wait, but the left and right pairs are two elements each. So the elements in the left pair (a and b) and the right pair (d and e) can be any elements from their respective regions. 

But the problem is that the elements in the left and right pairs can include elements other than x, and their counts in the entire subsequence (left pair + right pair) must be less than x_count. 

So for example, if in the left pair, there is a y (y !=x) that appears once, and in the right pair, there is a y that appears once, then the total count of y in the subsequence is 2. So if x_count is 3, then 2 <3, which is okay. 

But if x_count is 2, then y's count is 2, which is equal to x_count, which is invalid. 

So for each possible combination of l_x and r_x, we need to compute the number of left and right pairs such that:

- The left pair has exactly l_x x's. 

- The right pair has exactly r_x x's. 

- For all elements y in the left and right pairs (excluding x), the total count of y in the left and right pairs is less than x_count. 

But how to model this. 

Let's think of the left pair. For the left pair (a, b), which are two elements from the elements before i. Let's denote the elements before i as L. 

The left pair can have 0, 1, or 2 x's. For each possible l_x (0,1,2), we need to count the number of left pairs with exactly l_x x's, and also track the counts of other elements in those pairs. 

Similarly for the right pair. 

But this seems computationally expensive. 

Alternative approach: For each x (middle element) at position i, precompute the counts of x in the left and right regions. Then, for each possible l_x and r_x, compute x_count = 1 + l_x + r_x. Then, for the left and right pairs, we need to select pairs that have exactly l_x and r_x x's, respectively, and that the maximum count of any other element in the left and right pairs is less than x_count. 

But how to compute the maximum count of other elements in the left and right pairs. 

Wait, the left pair can have elements from the left region (before i). The right pair can have elements from the right region (after i). 

So for the left pair, the elements are from L (elements before i). For the right pair, elements are from R (elements after i). 

So the elements in the left and right pairs are from L and R, respectively. 

So the elements in the left pair can be any two elements from L, and the right pair any two from R. 

But the problem is that the same element can appear in both L and R. For example, if L has a y and R has a y, then the total count of y in the subsequence is the sum of their occurrences in the left and right pairs. 

But how to track this. 

This seems very complex. 

Alternative idea: For each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible l_x and r_x, compute x_count = 1 + l_x + r_x. Then, the maximum count of any other element in the subsequence is the maximum of:

- The count of y in the left pair (for y !=x) 

- The count of y in the right pair (for y !=x) 

But since the left and right pairs are from separate regions, the same y can appear in both. 

So the total count of y in the subsequence is (count in left pair) + (count in right pair). 

But how to compute the maximum of these for all y !=x. 

This seems difficult. 

Alternative approach: For each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible l_x and r_x, compute x_count. Then, the maximum count of any other element in the subsequence is the maximum between the maximum count in the left pair (excluding x) and the maximum count in the right pair (excluding x), plus any overlapping elements. 

Wait, but if a y appears in both the left and right pairs, their counts add up. 

So for example, if the left pair has a y once, and the right pair has a y once, then the total count is 2. 

So the maximum count of any other element in the subsequence is the maximum over all y !=x of (left_count[y] + right_count[y]). 

But how to compute this. 

This seems very challenging. 

Alternative idea: For each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible l_x and r_x, compute x_count. Then, the maximum count of any other element in the subsequence is the maximum of:

- The maximum count in the left pair (excluding x) 

- The maximum count in the right pair (excluding x) 

- The sum of the count of a particular y in the left and right pairs. 

But this is not correct. For example, if the left pair has a y once, and the right pair has a y once, the total is 2. But if another element z has a count of 1 in the left and 0 in the right, then the maximum is 2. 

So the maximum is the maximum of all possible (left_count[y] + right_count[y]) for y !=x. 

But how to compute this. 

This seems computationally infeasible for large arrays. 

Alternative approach: Let's think of the problem in terms of the possible x_count. For each x (middle element) and possible x_count, compute the number of left and right pairs such that:

- The left pair has l_x x's. 

- The right pair has r_x x's. 

- x_count = 1 + l_x + r_x. 

- For all y !=x, the total count of y in the left and right pairs is less than x_count. 

But how to model this. 

Let's consider that for a given x_count, the maximum allowed count of any other element in the subsequence is x_count -1. 

So for each y !=x, the sum of their counts in the left and right pairs must be <= x_count -1. 

But how to compute this. 

This seems like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming, but I'm not sure. 

Alternative idea: For each x (middle element) at position i, precompute the left and right regions. 

For the left region (elements before i), compute the frequency of each element. For the right region (elements after i), compute the frequency of each element. 

Then, for each possible l_x (0,1,2) and r_x (0,1,2), compute x_count = 1 + l_x + r_x. 

For each such x_count, we need to count the number of left pairs with l_x x's and the number of right pairs with r_x x's, such that for all y !=x, the sum of their counts in the left and right pairs is less than x_count. 

But how to compute this. 

Let's break it down into steps:

1. For the left region, compute the number of pairs (a, b) that have exactly l_x x's, and for each such pair, track the counts of other elements. 

But tracking the counts of other elements for each pair is not feasible. 

Alternative approach: For the left region, precompute the number of pairs with exactly l_x x's, and also track the maximum count of any other element in those pairs. 

Similarly for the right region. 

But even this is not straightforward. 

Alternatively, for the left region, when selecting a pair with l_x x's, the other elements in the pair can be any elements except x. So the maximum count of any other element in the left pair is the maximum frequency of any element (other than x) in the left pair. 

But how to compute this. 

Alternatively, for the left region, the number of pairs with exactly l_x x's is C(left_x_count, l_x) * C(left_non_x_count, 2 - l_x), where left_x_count is the number of x's in the left region, and left_non_x_count is the number of elements in the left region that are not x. 

Wait, no. Because the left region has left_x_count x's and left_non_x_count non-x elements. 

The number of pairs with exactly l_x x's is:

C(left_x_count, l_x) * C(left_non_x_count, 2 - l_x). 

But this is only if the left pair is formed by choosing l_x x's from the left_x_count x's, and (2 - l_x) non-x elements from the left_non_x_count. 

But this is correct. 

Similarly for the right region. 

But this approach ignores the counts of other elements. For example, if the left pair has two non-x elements, both being y, then the count of y in the left pair is 2. 

But in this case, the maximum count of any other element in the left pair is 2. 

But how to track this. 

Hmm. So for the left pair, the maximum count of any other element is the maximum frequency of any element (other than x) in the pair. 

But how to compute this. 

This seems difficult. 

Alternative idea: For the left pair, the maximum count of any other element can be 0, 1, or 2. 

For example, if the pair has two different elements, then the maximum is 1. If the pair has two of the same element, then the maximum is 2. 

Similarly for the right pair. 

So for each possible l_x and r_x, and for each possible maximum count in the left and right pairs, we can compute whether the sum is less than x_count. 

But this is getting complicated. 

Let me think of the possible scenarios for the left and right pairs. 

For the left pair:

Case A: l_x = 0. Then the pair consists of two non-x elements. The maximum count of any other element in the pair is 2 (if both are the same) or 1 (if they are different). 

Case B: l_x = 1. Then the pair has one x and one non-x. The maximum count of any other element is 1 (the non-x element). 

Case C: l_x = 2. Then the pair has two x's. The maximum count of any other element is 0. 

Similarly for the right pair. 

So for each l_x and r_x, the possible maximum counts in the left and right pairs are known. 

Then, the maximum count of any other element in the entire subsequence is the maximum of:

- The maximum count in the left pair (excluding x) 

- The maximum count in the right pair (excluding x) 

- The sum of the counts of a particular element in the left and right pairs. 

But this is still complicated. 

Alternative approach: For each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible l_x and r_x, compute x_count = 1 + l_x + r_x. 

Then, the maximum count of any other element in the subsequence is the maximum between:

a) The maximum count in the left pair (excluding x) 

b) The maximum count in the right pair (excluding x) 

c) The sum of the count of a particular element in the left and right pairs. 

But how to compute this. 

Alternatively, the maximum count of any other element in the subsequence is the maximum of:

- The maximum count in the left pair (excluding x) 

- The maximum count in the right pair (excluding x) 

- The sum of the count of a particular element in the left and right pairs. 

But this is not necessarily correct. For example, if the left pair has a y once, and the right pair has a y once, then the sum is 2. If the left pair's maximum is 1 (another element z), and the right pair's maximum is 1 (another element w), then the overall maximum is 2. 

So the maximum is the maximum of all possible sums of counts of elements in the left and right pairs. 

But how to compute this. 

This seems impossible to compute efficiently. 

Alternative idea: For each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible l_x and r_x, compute x_count. Then, the maximum count of any other element in the subsequence is the maximum between the maximum count in the left pair (excluding x), the maximum count in the right pair (excluding x), and the sum of the counts of any element in the left and right pairs. 

But this is not feasible to compute for all possible elements. 

Alternative approach: Let's consider that for the subsequence to be valid, the maximum count of any other element in the subsequence must be less than x_count. 

So, for each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible l_x and r_x, compute x_count. Then, the following must hold:

max_left_non_x < x_count 

max_right_non_x < x_count 

max_overlap < x_count 

where max_left_non_x is the maximum count of any non-x element in the left pair, max_right_non_x is the maximum count of any non-x element in the right pair, and max_overlap is the maximum sum of counts of any non-x element in the left and right pairs. 

But how to compute these values. 

This seems very challenging. 

Alternative idea: Let's consider that the maximum count of any other element in the subsequence is the maximum of:

- The maximum count in the left pair (excluding x) 

- The maximum count in the right pair (excluding x) 

- The sum of the count of a particular element in the left and right pairs. 

But to compute this, we can precompute for the left and right regions the possible maximum counts and the possible elements that can contribute to the sum. 

But this is still not clear. 

Alternative approach: Let's think of the problem in terms of the possible x_count. For each x (middle element) and possible x_count, compute the number of left and right pairs such that:

- The left pair has l_x x's. 

- The right pair has r_x x's. 

- x_count = 1 + l_x + r_x. 

- For all y !=x, the count of y in the left and right pairs is less than x_count. 

But how to model this. 

Let's consider that for a given x_count, the maximum allowed count of any other element in the subsequence is x_count -1. 

So for each y !=x, the sum of their counts in the left and right pairs must be <= x_count -1. 

But how to compute this. 

This seems like a problem that can be modeled with inclusion-exclusion. 

But I'm not sure. 

Alternative idea: For each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible l_x and r_x, compute x_count. Then, the number of valid left and right pairs is the product of the number of left pairs with l_x x's and the number of right pairs with r_x x's, multiplied by the probability that all other elements in the subsequence have counts less than x_count. 

But this is not helpful. 

Alternative approach: Let's think of the problem in terms of the possible x_count and the maximum count of other elements. 

For example, if x_count is 2, then all other elements in the subsequence must appear at most once. 

If x_count is 3, then other elements can appear at most twice. 

Wait, no. Because x_count is 3, other elements can appear up to 2 times. 

So for x_count = t, other elements can appear up to t-1 times. 

So for each x_count, the maximum allowed count of any other element is t-1. 

So for a given x_count, the problem reduces to counting the number of left and right pairs such that:

- The left pair has l_x x's. 

- The right pair has r_x x's. 

- x_count = 1 + l_x + r_x. 

- For all y !=x, the sum of their counts in the left and right pairs is <= t-1. 

But how to compute this. 

This seems like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming, but I'm not sure. 

Alternative idea: For each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible l_x and r_x, compute x_count. Then, for the left and right pairs, compute the number of pairs that have exactly l_x and r_x x's, respectively, and that the sum of counts of any other element in the left and right pairs is less than x_count. 

But how to compute this. 

Let's think of the left pair. For the left pair to have exactly l_x x's, the number of such pairs is C(left_x_count, l_x) * C(left_non_x_count, 2 - l_x). 

But this is the total number of pairs with l_x x's, regardless of the other elements. 

But we need to also ensure that the other elements in the left pair do not contribute to a sum that exceeds x_count -1 when combined with the right pair. 

But this is not possible to compute directly. 

Alternative approach: For each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible l_x and r_x, compute x_count. Then, the number of valid left and right pairs is the product of the number of left pairs with l_x x's and the number of right pairs with r_x x's, multiplied by the probability that the sum of counts of any other element in the left and right pairs is less than x_count. 

But this is not helpful. 

Alternative idea: Let's precompute for each x (middle element) the left and right regions. For the left region, compute the frequency of each element. For the right region, compute the frequency of each element. 

Then, for each possible l_x and r_x, compute x_count. 

For the left pair with l_x x's, the other elements in the pair are (2 - l_x) elements from the non-x elements in the left region. 

Similarly for the right pair. 

The maximum count of any other element in the left pair is the maximum frequency of any element in the left pair's non-x elements. 

Similarly for the right pair. 

The sum of the counts of any element in the left and right pairs is the sum of their frequencies in the left and right pairs. 

But how to compute the maximum of these sums. 

This seems impossible to compute efficiently. 

Alternative approach: Let's consider that for the subsequence to be valid, the maximum count of any other element in the subsequence must be less than x_count. 

So, for each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible l_x and r_x, compute x_count. Then, the following must hold:

max_left_non_x + max_right_non_x < x_count 

where max_left_non_x is the maximum count of any non-x element in the left pair, and max_right_non_x is the maximum count of any non-x element in the right pair. 

But this is not correct. For example, if the left pair has a y once, and the right pair has a y once, then the sum is 2. If x_count is 3, then 2 <3 is okay. But if max_left_non_x is 1 and max_right_non_x is 1, their sum is 2. 

But this approach would require that the sum of the maximum counts in the left and right pairs is less than x_count. 

But this is not necessarily the case. For example, if the left pair has a y once, and the right pair has a z once, then the sum of their counts is 1+1=2, which is less than x_count=3. 

But if the left pair has a y twice (max_left_non_x=2), and the right pair has a z once (max_right_non_x=1), then the sum of their counts is 2+1=3, which is equal to x_count=3. So this would be invalid. 

But according to this approach, the sum of the max counts (2+1=3) is equal to x_count, which is invalid. 

So this approach would correctly capture that case. 

But how to compute the sum of the maximum counts in the left and right pairs. 

But this is not the same as the maximum sum of counts of any element. 

For example, if the left pair has y once and z once (max_left_non_x=1), and the right pair has y once and w once (max_right_non_x=1), then the sum of the max counts is 1+1=2, but the sum of y's counts is 2. 

So the maximum sum is 2, which is higher than the sum of the max counts. 

So this approach would not capture that case. 

Thus, this approach is not correct. 

Alternative idea: For each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible l_x and r_x, compute x_count. Then, the maximum count of any other element in the subsequence is the maximum between the maximum count in the left pair, the maximum count in the right pair, and the sum of the counts of any element in the left and right pairs. 

But how to compute this. 

This seems impossible to compute efficiently. 

Alternative approach: Let's think of the problem in terms of the possible x_count. For each x_count, the maximum allowed count of any other element is x_count-1. 

So for each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible l_x and r_x, compute x_count. Then, the number of valid left and right pairs is the product of the number of left pairs with l_x x's and the number of right pairs with r_x x's, multiplied by the probability that all other elements in the left and right pairs have counts (summed) less than x_count. 

But how to compute this probability. 

This is where the problem becomes challenging.

But how to compute this. 

This is where the problem becomes computationally intensive. 

Alternative idea: For each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible l_x and r_x, compute x_count. Then, the number of valid left and right pairs is the product of the number of left pairs with l_x x's and the number of right pairs with r_x x's, multiplied by the probability that for all elements y !=x, the sum of their counts in the left and right pairs is less than x_count. 

But how to compute this. 

This seems like a problem that can be modeled with generating functions. 

For example, for the left pair, we can model the possible counts of elements and track the maximum. 

But this is getting into advanced combinatorics, which may be difficult to implement. 

Alternative approach: Let's think of the problem in terms of the possible x_count and the maximum count of any other element. 

For example, if x_count is 2, then all other elements in the subsequence must appear at most once. 

So for the left and right pairs, the elements must be distinct and not x. 

So for the left pair, if l_x is 0, then the pair must consist of two distinct non-x elements. 

If l_x is 1, then the pair has one x and one non-x element. 

If l_x is 2, then the pair has two x's. 

Similarly for the right pair. 

But this is only valid when x_count is 2. 

So for x_count=2, the left pair must have 0 x's (l_x=0) and the right pair must have 0 x's (r_x=0), or l_x=1 and r_x=0, or l_x=0 and r_x=1. 

Wait, no. x_count=1 + l_x + r_x. So for x_count=2, l_x + r_x =1. 

So possible combinations are (l_x=0, r_x=1), (l_x=1, r_x=0), (l_x=2, r_x=-1) which is invalid. 

So only (0,1) and (1,0) are possible. 

But for x_count=2, the other elements in the subsequence must appear at most once. 

So for the left pair (l_x=0), the pair must consist of two distinct non-x elements. 

For the right pair (r_x=1), the pair has one x and one non-x element. 

But the non-x element in the right pair must not appear in the left pair. 

So this is getting very complicated. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. 

Alternative idea: Let's consider that the middle element is x. For the subsequence to have x as the unique mode, x must appear more times than any other element. 

So, in the subsequence, the count of x is t, and all other elements have counts <t. 

The subsequence has 5 elements, so t can be 2,3,4,5. 

For each possible t, we can compute the number of subsequences where x appears t times, and all other elements appear less than t times. 

But how to compute this. 

For example, t=5: all elements are x. So the number of such subsequences is the number of ways to choose 5 x's from the array, and the middle element is x. 

But the middle element is the third element of the subsequence. So for a subsequence of 5 x's, the middle element is x. 

So the number of such subsequences is the number of ways to choose 5 x's from the array, multiplied by the number of ways to choose the middle element as one of the x's. 

Wait, no. Because the subsequence is formed by selecting elements in order. So for a subsequence of 5 x's, the middle element is the third x in the subsequence. 

But the positions of the x's in the array must be in increasing order. 

So the number of such subsequences is the number of ways to choose 5 x's from the array, and the third one is the middle element. 

But since all elements are x, any selection of 5 x's will have the third one as the middle element. 

So the number of such subsequences is C(count_x,5), where count_x is the total number of x's in the array. 

But wait, no. Because the subsequence is formed by selecting elements in order. So the number of 5-length subsequences of x's is C(count_x,5). 

But the middle element is the third one. So each such subsequence contributes 1 to the count. 

So for t=5, the number of valid subsequences is C(count_x,5). 

Similarly, for t=4: the subsequence has four x's and one other element. The other element can be any element not x. 

The middle element is x. 

So the subsequence has four x's and one other element. 

The count of x is 4, which is the mode. 

So the number of such subsequences is the number of ways to choose four x's and one non-x element, such that the middle element is x. 

But how to model this. 

The subsequence has five elements, with four x's and one non-x. The middle element is x. 

So the structure is [a, x, x, x, d], where a and d are non-x elements. 

But the positions of the x's and the other elements must be in order. 

Alternatively, the subsequence can have four x's and one non-x element in any positions, but the middle element must be x. 

So the non-x element can be in any of the first two, fourth, or fifth positions. 

But this is getting complicated. 

Alternative idea: For t=4, the subsequence has four x's and one other element. The middle element is x. 

So the other element can be in any of the first two, fourth, or fifth positions. 

But the count of x is 4, which is the mode. 

So the number of such subsequences is the number of ways to choose four x's and one non-x element, and arrange them such that the middle element is x. 

But how to compute this. 

The total number of such subsequences is:

number of ways to choose four x's and one non-x element) * number of ways to arrange them with x in the middle. 

But the arrangement must preserve the order of the original array. 

This seems difficult. 

Alternative approach: For each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible t (x_count), compute the number of valid left and right pairs. 

But this is similar to the previous approach. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different way to model the problem. 

Alternative idea: Let's consider that the middle element is x. For the subsequence to have x as the unique mode, the count of x in the subsequence must be greater than the count of any other element. 

So, for each x in the array, we can consider all possible subsequences where x is the middle element, and x's count in the subsequence is t, and all other elements have count <t. 

The total number of such subsequences is the sum over t of the number of subsequences where x is the middle element, x's count is t, and other elements have count <t. 

But how to compute this. 

For each x in the array, and for each possible t (2,3,4,5), compute the number of subsequences where x is the middle element, x's count is t, and other elements have count <t. 

But how. 

For example, t=5: all elements are x. 

The number of such subsequences is C(count_x,5), but only if the middle element is x. 

Wait, but any subsequence of 5 x's will have x as the middle element. So the count is C(count_x,5). 

For t=4: the subsequence has four x's and one other element. The other element can be in any of the five positions except the middle. 

But the middle element is x. 

So the other element can be in positions 0,1,3,4. 

But the subsequence must have x in the middle. 

So the structure is [a, x, x, x, d], where a and d are non-x elements. 

But this is not the only possible structure. The other element can be in any of the first two positions, or the last two. 

For example, [x, x, x, x, y], [x, x, x, y, x], [x, x, y, x, x], etc. 

But the middle element is x. 

So the other element can be in any of the first two, fourth, or fifth positions. 

But how to count the number of such subsequences. 

The total number of such subsequences is the number of ways to choose four x's and one non-x element, and arrange them such that the middle element is x. 

But the arrangement must preserve the order of the original array. 

This seems difficult. 

Alternative idea: For each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible t (x_count), compute the number of valid left and right pairs. 

But this is similar to the previous approach. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a way to model this problem using combinatorics and frequency counts. 

Another idea: For each x in the array, and for each possible occurrence of x as the middle element, compute the number of valid left and right pairs. 

The left pairs are two elements before x's position, and the right pairs are two elements after x's position. 

For each possible left pair and right pair, check if the middle element x is the unique mode. 

But this is O(n^4) time, which is not feasible for n=1000. 

But perhaps we can optimize this. 

Wait, the array can be up to 1000 elements. For each x in the array (1000 possibilities), and for each occurrence of x (up to 1000), we need to process. 

For each x occurrence, the left and right regions can be up to 999 elements each. 

But even then, for each x occurrence, the number of left pairs is C(left_length, 2), which for left_length=999 is about 500k. Similarly for the right pairs. 

So for each x occurrence, the number of left and right pairs is O( (n^2) * (n^2) ) = O(n^4), which is 1e12 operations for n=1000. This is way too slow. 

So this approach is not feasible. 

Alternative idea: Precompute for each x the number of x's in the array, and their positions. Then, for each possible x_count (2,3,4,5), compute the number of subsequences where x is the middle element, x_count is t, and other elements have count <t. 

But how. 

For example, for t=5: the number of subsequences is C(count_x,5). 

For t=4: the number of subsequences is count_x * (count_x -1) * (count_x -2) * (count_x -3) * (count_x_total - count_x) * ... ? 

Not sure. 

Alternatively, for t=4, the subsequence has four x's and one other element. The other element can be any element not x. 

The number of such subsequences is C(count_x,4) * (total_non_x) * ... but this is not correct. 

Because the other element can be in any position except the middle. 

But the middle element is x. 

So the other element can be in any of the five positions except the third. 

But the subsequence must have x in the third position. 

So the other element can be in positions 0,1,3,4. 

But the positions are determined by the original array. 

This seems very complex. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for hints or think of the problem differently. 

Alternative idea: The middle element is the third element of the subsequence. So for a subsequence of five elements, the third element is fixed as x. 

So for each occurrence of x in the array, we can consider it as the middle element. 

Then, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to choose two elements before x and two elements after x, such that in the entire subsequence, x is the unique mode. 

So for each x at position i, the number of valid subsequences is the number of valid left pairs (two elements before i) multiplied by the number of valid right pairs (two elements after i), such that the combined subsequence has x as the unique mode. 

But how to compute the valid left and right pairs. 

For each x at position i, the left pairs are two elements from the elements before i. The right pairs are two elements from the elements after i. 

The combined subsequence is [a, b, x, d, e], where a and b are from the left, d and e from the right. 

The count of x in the subsequence is 1 (middle) + the number of x's in a and b + the number of x's in d and e. 

The other elements in the subsequence are a, b, d, e. 

For x to be the unique mode, the count of x must be greater than the count of any other element in the subsequence. 

So for each x at position i, we need to compute the number of left and right pairs such that:

x_count = 1 + left_x + right_x 

and for all y in {a, b, d, e} where y !=x, count(y) < x_count. 

But how to compute this. 

Let's think of the possible x_count values. 

x_count can be 1 + left_x + right_x. 

left_x is the number of x's in the left pair (a and b). 

right_x is the number of x's in the right pair (d and e). 

Possible values for left_x and right_x are 0, 1, or 2. 

So x_count can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. 

But since the subsequence has 5 elements, x_count must be at least 1. 

But for x to be the mode, x_count must be at least 2. Because if x_count is 1, then other elements can have counts up to 1, leading to a tie. 

So x_count must be >=2. 

So possible x_count values are 2,3,4,5. 

For each x_count, we need to compute the number of left and right pairs such that:

- left_x + right_x = x_count -1 

- For all y in the left and right pairs (excluding x), the count of y in the subsequence is < x_count. 

But how to model this. 

Let's break it down for each x_count:

Case 1: x_count = 2. 

Then, left_x + right_x = 1. 

So possible combinations are (left_x=0, right_x=1), (left_x=1, right_x=0). 

For each combination, we need to compute the number of left and right pairs such that:

- The left pair has left_x x's. 

- The right pair has right_x x's. 

- For all y in the left and right pairs (excluding x), the count of y in the subsequence is <2. 

So for the left pair (left_x=0), the pair must consist of two distinct non-x elements. 

For the right pair (right_x=1), the pair has one x and one non-x element. 

The non-x element in the right pair must not appear in the left pair. 

So the left pair has two distinct non-x elements, and the right pair has one x and one non-x element that is not in the left pair. 

But this is getting complicated. 

Case 2: x_count =3. 

Then, left_x + right_x =2. 

Possible combinations: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). 

For each combination, we need to compute the number of left and right pairs such that:

- The left pair has left_x x's. 

- The right pair has right_x x's. 

- For all y in the left and right pairs (excluding x), the count of y in the subsequence is <3. 

So for example, if left_x=0 and right_x=2, the left pair has two non-x elements (distinct), and the right pair has two x's. 

The non-x elements in the left pair must not appear in the right pair. 

But the right pair has two x's, so no non-x elements. 

So the non-x elements in the left pair can be any two distinct elements, and the right pair has two x's. 

In this case, the count of x is 3 (1 +0 +2), and the other elements have count 1. 

So this is valid. 

But if the left pair has two of the same non-x element, then the count of that element is 2, which is less than 3. 

So this is allowed. 

So for x_count=3, the left and right pairs can have non-x elements with counts up to 2. 

But how to compute this. 

This is getting very complicated. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a way to model this problem using dynamic programming or combinatorics. 

Another idea: For each x (middle element) at position i, precompute the left and right regions. 

For the left region, compute the frequency of each element. 

For the right region, compute the frequency of each element. 

Then, for each possible left_x and right_x, compute x_count. 

For each x_count, compute the maximum allowed count of other elements. 

Then, for the left and right pairs, compute the number of pairs that have exactly left_x and right_x x's, and that the sum of counts of any other element in the left and right pairs is less than x_count. 

But how to compute this. 

This seems to require for each x (middle element) and for each possible left_x and right_x, to compute the number of left pairs with left_x x's and the number of right pairs with right_x x's, and then multiply them, but only if the maximum count of any other element in the left and right pairs is less than x_count. 

But how to compute the maximum count of other elements. 

Alternative idea: For the left pair, the maximum count of any other element is the maximum frequency of any element in the left pair (excluding x). 

Similarly for the right pair. 

The sum of the maximum counts of the left and right pairs must be less than x_count. 

But this is not correct. 

For example, if the left pair has a y once and the right pair has a y once, the sum is 2. If x_count is 3, this is allowed. 

But the sum of the maximum counts (1+1=2) is less than x_count. 

But if the left pair has a y twice and the right pair has a z once, the sum of the maximum counts is 2+1=3, which is equal to x_count=3. So this is invalid. 

But the sum of the counts of y and z is 2+1=3, which is equal to x_count. 

So this approach would correctly capture that case. 

But how to compute the sum of the maximum counts. 

This seems difficult. 

At this point, I'm stuck. I think I need to look for a different approach. 

Alternative idea: For each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible left_x and right_x, compute x_count. Then, the number of valid left and right pairs is the product of the number of left pairs with left_x x's and the number of right pairs with right_x x's, multiplied by the probability that for all elements y !=x, the sum of their counts in the left and right pairs is less than x_count. 

But how to compute this probability. 

This is where the problem becomes challenging. 

Perhaps the key is to precompute for each x (middle element) the left and right regions, and for each possible left_x and right_x, compute the maximum count of any other element in the left and right pairs, and their sum. 

But this is not feasible for large arrays. 

At this point, I'm stuck and need to think of a different approach. 

Another idea: The problem requires that the middle element is the unique mode. So, the middle element's count must be strictly greater than the count of any other element in the subsequence. 

So, for each x (middle element) at position i, the subsequence is [a, b, x, d, e]. 

The count of x is 1 + count_a_x + count_b_x + count_d_x + count_e_x. 

But a and b are elements before i, d and e are elements after i. 

So, the count of x in the subsequence is 1 + the number of x's in a and b (from the left region) + the number of x's in d and e (from the right region). 

The other elements in the subsequence are a, b, d, e. 

For each of these elements y !=x, their count in the subsequence is the number of times they appear in a, b, d, e. 

So, the problem reduces to ensuring that for all y !=x, count(y) < x_count. 

But how to compute this. 

Alternative idea: For each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible left_x and right_x, compute x_count. Then, the number of valid left and right pairs is the product of the number of left pairs with left_x x's and the number of right pairs with right_x x's, multiplied by the probability that for all y !=x, the sum of their counts in the left and right pairs is less than x_count. 

But how to compute this probability. 

This is where the problem becomes computationally intensive. 

At this point, I'm stuck and need to think of a different approach. 

Perhaps the key is to precompute for each x (middle element) the left and right regions, and for each possible left_x and right_x, compute the maximum count of any other element in the left and right pairs. 

But how. 

Alternatively, for each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible left_x and right_x, compute x_count. Then, the number of valid left and right pairs is the product of the number of left pairs with left_x x's and the number of right pairs with right_x x's, multiplied by the probability that the maximum count of any other element in the left and right pairs is less than x_count. 

But how to compute this. 

This seems like a dead end. 

At this point, I think I need to look for a way to model this problem using dynamic programming or combinatorics. 

Another idea: For each x (middle element) at position i, and for each possible left_x and right_x, compute x_count. Then, the number of valid left and right pairs is the product of the number of left pairs with left_x x's and the number of right pairs with right_x x's, multiplied by the probability that for all elements y !=x, the sum of their counts in the left and right pairs is less than x_count.
