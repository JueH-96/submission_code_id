Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the shortest subarray in an infinite array made by repeating nums that sums up to the target. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, the problem says the infinite array is formed by appending nums infinitely. So any subarray in the infinite array can be part of a full cycle of nums, a partial cycle at the beginning, middle, or end. But how do I model this efficiently?

The brute force approach would be to check all possible subarrays, but that's impossible because the array is infinite. So I need a smarter way.

Wait, the key here is that the sum of the entire nums array is important. Let's call the sum of nums as total_sum. If the target is larger than the total_sum, then the subarray must span multiple full cycles plus some elements. But if the target is smaller than the total_sum, then maybe the subarray is within a single cycle or a partial part.

Wait, but even if the target is larger than the total_sum, maybe the sum can be achieved by combining parts of the cycle. For example, if the total_sum is 6 (like in example 1, sum is 6), and target is 5, which is less than 6. So the subarray could be in a single cycle. But if the target is, say, 7, then maybe it's two full cycles (sum 12) minus some elements. Wait, but that's not possible because the subarray is contiguous. So maybe the approach is to consider the prefix sums and look for cases where the sum difference is equal to the target, but with some modulo operations.

Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of the prefix sums. Let's compute the prefix sums of the infinite array. But since it's infinite, we can't compute all of them. So we need to find a way to model the possible prefix sums that can occur.

Let me think. The infinite array is nums repeated over and over. So the prefix sum after k full cycles plus m elements (m < len(nums)) is: k * total_sum + prefix_sum[m], where prefix_sum is the array of cumulative sums of nums. For example, if nums is [1,2,3], then the prefix sums are [1,3,6]. So after one full cycle (3 elements), the sum is 6. After two cycles, it's 12, etc.

So any subarray in the infinite array can be represented as starting at position (c1 * len(nums) + i) and ending at (c2 * len(nums) + j), where c1 and c2 are the number of full cycles before the start and end, and i and j are indices within nums. The sum of this subarray would be (c2 - c1) * total_sum + (prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i-1]).

But how do we find the minimal length subarray that sums to target?

Hmm. Let's consider that the minimal subarray could be in one of the following cases:

1. It's entirely within a single cycle. So the sum is achieved by a subarray in the original nums array. So we can check all possible subarrays in nums and see if their sum is target. The minimal length here would be the answer if found.

2. It spans two or more full cycles. For example, if the target is larger than the sum of the entire nums array, then the subarray might consist of multiple full cycles plus some elements. But how to model this?

Wait, but if the target is larger than the sum of the entire array, then the minimal subarray would have to include at least two full cycles. But maybe even more. For example, if the sum of the array is 5, and the target is 11, then maybe two full cycles (sum 10) plus one element (sum 1) gives 11. But the length would be 2*3 +1=7. But maybe there's a shorter way. Hmm, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal subarray can be found by considering the prefix sums and looking for pairs where the difference is equal to the target, but with some modulo operations.

Let me think of the prefix sum array. Let's say the prefix sum array of the infinite array is S. Then, for any two indices i < j, the sum of the subarray from i to j-1 is S[j] - S[i]. We need to find the minimal (j - i) such that S[j] - S[i] = target.

But since the array is infinite, S can be very large. So we need a way to model S[j] and S[i] in terms of the original nums array.

Let's denote the original nums array's prefix sum as P, where P[0] = 0, P[1] = nums[0], P[2] = nums[0] + nums[1], etc. The length of P is len(nums)+1.

Then, the prefix sum S of the infinite array can be written as S[k] = (k // n) * total_sum + P[k % n], where n is the length of nums. For example, if k is 4 and n is 3, then S[4] = 1 * total_sum + P[1].

So, for any j and i in the infinite array, S[j] - S[i] = ( (j//n - i//n) * total_sum ) + ( P[j%n] - P[i%n] )

We need this difference to be equal to target. Let's denote the number of full cycles between i and j as d = (j//n - i//n). So d can be 0, 1, 2, etc. But since j > i, d is non-negative.

So the equation becomes:

d * total_sum + (P[j%n] - P[i%n]) = target.

We need to find i and j such that this equation holds, and j - i is minimized.

But how to find such i and j efficiently?

Let's consider different cases based on the value of d.

Case 1: d = 0. Then the equation becomes P[j%n] - P[i%n] = target. Since j and i are in the same cycle, j%n and i%n are just their positions in the original array. So this is equivalent to finding a subarray in the original nums array that sums to target. The minimal length here is the minimal length of such a subarray. If such a subarray exists, then the answer could be the minimal between this and other possibilities.

Case 2: d >= 1. Then the equation is d * total_sum + (P[j%n] - P[i%n]) = target. Let's rearrange this as (P[j%n] - P[i%n]) = target - d * total_sum. Since d is at least 1, the right-hand side is target - d * total_sum. But since the sum of the subarray is target, and the subarray spans d full cycles plus some elements, perhaps the minimal length is when d is as small as possible.

But how to model this?

Alternatively, for each possible d, we can check if there exists a pair (i, j) such that the equation holds, and compute the minimal j - i.

But d can be up to (target // total_sum) + 1, but since total_sum can be up to 1e5 * 1e5 = 1e10, and target is up to 1e9, d can be up to 1e9 / 1 (if total_sum is 1). So this approach might not be feasible for large d.

Hmm, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think about the possible values of d. For the equation to hold, target - d * total_sum must be achievable as a difference between two prefix sums in the original array. So for each possible d, we can compute the required difference (target - d * total_sum) and check if there exists two prefix sums in P where their difference is equal to that value. Then, the minimal j - i would be (d * n) + (j - i) in the original array. Wait, no. Because j and i are in different cycles. For example, if i is in cycle c1 and j is in cycle c2, then j - i = (c2 - c1)*n + (j%n - i%n). But since d = c2 - c1, the total length is (c2 - c1)*n + (j%n - i%n). But j%n and i%n can be in any order. Wait, but j must be after i, so j%n can be less than i%n if c2 - c1 is positive. For example, if i is at position 2 in cycle c1, and j is at position 1 in cycle c2 (c2 = c1 + 1), then j%n is 1, i%n is 2. So j%n - i%n is -1, but the actual positions are (c1+1)*n +1 and c1*n +2. So the difference is (c1+1)*n +1 - (c1*n +2) = n -1. So the length is (c2 - c1)*n + (j%n - i%n) if j%n >= i%n, else (c2 - c1)*n + (n - (i%n - j%n)).

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, for each possible d, the required difference is (target - d * total_sum). Let's call this required_diff. We need to find two indices i and j in the original prefix sum array such that P[j] - P[i] = required_diff. Then, the length of the subarray in the infinite array would be (d * n) + (j - i). Because the subarray spans d full cycles (each of length n) plus the elements from i to j-1 in the original array. Wait, no. Because the subarray starts at i in some cycle and ends at j in a later cycle. For example, if i is in cycle c1 and j is in cycle c2 = c1 + d, then the number of elements is (c2 - c1)*n + (j - i). But j can be in the same cycle as i, but that's when d=0.

Wait, perhaps the minimal length when d is fixed is (d * n) + (j - i), where j and i are in the original array's prefix sums, and P[j] - P[i] = required_diff. But j must be >= i, because the subarray is from i to j-1 in the original array, then spans d cycles. Wait, no. Let's think again.

If the subarray starts at position (c1 * n + i) and ends at (c2 * n + j), where c2 = c1 + d. Then the sum is (c2 - c1)*total_sum + (P[j] - P[i]). So the required_diff is target - d * total_sum. So for each d, we need to find i and j in the original prefix sum array such that P[j] - P[i] = required_diff, and j >= i. Then the length of the subarray is (c2 - c1)*n + (j - i). But since c2 = c1 + d, the length is d * n + (j - i). But since c1 can be any integer (as the array is infinite), but the minimal length would be when c1 is as small as possible. Wait, but c1 can be any integer, but the subarray is in the infinite array, so the minimal possible c1 is 0. Because if we take a higher c1, the length would be longer. For example, if we have a subarray starting at c1=0, i=0, and ending at c2=d, j=5, then the length is d*n +5. If we take c1=1, then the length is (d)*n + (5 - (i)), but i would be in the next cycle. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, the minimal possible length for a given d is when the subarray starts in the first possible cycle (c1=0) and ends in cycle c2 = d. So the start index is i in the original array, and the end index is j in the original array, but in cycle d. So the length is d * n + (j - i). But j can be any index in the original array, and i can be any index less than or equal to j. Wait, but if j is in cycle d, then j can be up to n-1. So for example, if d=1, then the end index is in cycle 1, which is the same as cycle 0 in the original array. Wait, maybe this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps for a given d, the minimal possible length is (d * n) + (j - i), where j and i are in the original array's prefix sums, and P[j] - P[i] = required_diff. But j can be any index in the original array, and i can be any index less than or equal to j. Because the subarray would start at i in the first cycle, and end at j in the d-th cycle. Wait, but how?

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's think of an example.

Take example 1: nums = [1,2,3], target=5. The sum of nums is 6. The required_diff for d=0 is 5. So we look for P[j] - P[i] =5. The prefix sums are [0,1,3,6]. So possible pairs are (0,3) which gives 6-0=6 (no), (0,2) gives 3-0=3 (no), (0,1) gives 1-0=1 (no). (1,3) gives 6-1=5. So i=1, j=3. The length is (3-1) =2. Which is the correct answer.

Another example: example 2, nums = [1,1,1,2,3], target=4. The sum is 8. For d=0, required_diff is 4. The prefix sums are [0,1,2,3,5,8]. Looking for pairs where difference is 4. For example, 5-1=4 (i=1, j=4). The length is 4-1=3. But the correct answer is 2. So this approach would not find the correct answer. Wait, but in example 2, the correct answer is a subarray that spans two cycles. Let's see. The sum is 4, which is achieved by the subarray [2,3] in the second cycle. Wait, the nums array is [1,1,1,2,3]. The sum of the entire array is 8. So for d=0, required_diff is 4. The prefix sums are 0,1,2,3,5,8. So looking for pairs where P[j] - P[i] =4. For example, 5-1=4 (i=1, j=4). The subarray is from index 1 to 3 (since j is 4, the elements are 1,1,1,2,3. So indices 1 to 3 are 1,1,2, sum is 4. Wait, no. Wait, the prefix sum at j=4 is 5 (sum of first 4 elements: 1+1+1+2=5). So P[j] - P[i] =5-1=4. So the subarray is from i=1 (element 1) to j=4 (element 2). The elements are 1,1,2, sum is 4. The length is 3. But the correct answer is 2. So this approach would not find the correct answer. So the minimal length in this case is achieved when d=0, but the correct answer is found in a different way.

Wait, but in example 2, the correct answer is the subarray [2,3] which is in the original array. Wait, the nums array is [1,1,1,2,3]. The sum of 2+3 is 5, which is not 4. Wait, the example says the subarray is [4,5], which in the infinite array is the elements 2 and 3. Wait, the original array is [1,1,1,2,3]. So the fourth element (index 3) is 2, fifth (index4) is 3. So the sum is 2+3=5. But the example says the target is 4. Wait, that's confusing. Oh wait, example 2's input is nums = [1,1,1,2,3], target=4. The output is 2. The explanation says the subarray is [4,5], which in the infinite array is the elements 2 and 3. Wait, 2+3 is 5, but the target is 4. That can't be right. Oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example. Let me check again.

Wait, example 2's input is nums = [1,1,1,2,3], target=4. The output is 2, and the explanation says the subarray is [4,5], which in the infinite array is the elements 2 and 3. Wait, 2+3 is 5, which is not 4. That's a problem. Oh, perhaps there's a mistake in the example. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the indices.

Wait, the infinite array is [1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,...]. The subarray [4,5] would be the elements at positions 4 and 5 (0-based). Let's see: positions 0-4 are 1,1,1,2,3. Then positions 5-9 are 1,1,1,2,3 again. So position 4 is 3, position 5 is 1. Wait, no. Wait, the array is [1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,...]. So the first 5 elements are 1,1,1,2,3. Then the next 5 are 1,1,1,2,3 again. So the 4th index (0-based) is 2, the 5th is 3. So the subarray [4,5] is elements 2 and 3, sum 5. But the target is 4. So this can't be right. So there's a mistake here. Wait, perhaps the example explanation is wrong. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the example says the output is 2. So the sum must be 4. How? Let's see. The nums array is [1,1,1,2,3]. The sum of the first three 1's is 3. Then adding 1 (the next element) gives 4. So the subarray [0,3] (indices 0 to 3) would be 1+1+1+1=4. But that's length 4. But the example says the answer is 2. So perhaps the example is wrong. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the example is correct. Let me recheck. Oh, wait, the example says the subarray is in the range [4,5], which in the infinite array is the elements 2 and 3. But 2+3=5. So that's not possible. So there's a mistake here. But according to the problem statement, the output is 2. So perhaps the example is correct, and I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the nums array is [1,1,1,2,3], and the target is 4. The sum of the first three 1's is 3, then adding the next 1 (the fourth element) gives 4. So the subarray is [0,3], which is length 4. But the example says the answer is 2. So this is conflicting. So perhaps the example is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, maybe the example is correct, and I'm missing a case. Let's think again. Oh, wait, maybe the subarray is [3,4], which is elements 2 and 3. Sum is 5. Not 4. Hmm. So this is confusing. Maybe there's a typo in the example. Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the example 2 says:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,3], target =4. Output:2. Explanation: the subarray is [4,5], sum 4. So how?

Wait, perhaps the nums array is [1,1,1,2,3], and the infinite array is [1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,...]. The subarray [4,5] is the elements at positions 4 and 5. Position 4 is 3 (the fifth element of the first cycle), position 5 is 1 (the first element of the second cycle). So sum is 3+1=4. Oh! That's possible. So the subarray is from index 4 to 5 (inclusive?), but the sum is 3+1=4. So the length is 2. So the example is correct. So the subarray is [3,1], sum 4. So the elements are 3 (from the first cycle) and 1 (from the second cycle). So the sum is 4. So the minimal length is 2.

So in this case, the subarray spans two cycles. So the sum is (1 cycle sum) + (1) = 8 +1=9? No, wait. Wait, the sum of the first cycle is 1+1+1+2+3=8. The subarray is 3 (from first cycle) and 1 (from second cycle). So the sum is 3+1=4. So the sum is 4. So the subarray is of length 2. So how does this fit into the equation?

In this case, the subarray starts at index 4 (element 3) of the first cycle and ends at index 0 of the second cycle. So the start is in cycle 0, end in cycle 1. So d=1. The required_diff is target - d * total_sum =4 -1*8= -4. So we need P[j] - P[i] =-4. But P is the prefix sum of the original array. Let's see:

Original prefix sums are [0,1,2,3,5,8]. So for d=1, required_diff is 4-8= -4. So we need to find i and j in the original array's prefix sums such that P[j] - P[i] =-4. But since P is non-decreasing (all elements are positive), this is impossible. So how does this example work?

Ah, here's the problem. The approach I was considering earlier may not capture this case. Because in this example, the subarray spans two cycles, but the required_diff is negative, which can't be found in the original prefix sums. So the previous approach of checking for d=0 and d>=1 may not work.

So this suggests that the previous approach is missing some cases. So I need to think differently.

Alternative approach: The minimal subarray can be in one of the following cases:

1. It is entirely within the original array (d=0). So check all possible subarrays in nums.

2. It starts in the original array and ends in the next cycle (d=1). So the subarray wraps around the end of the array.

3. It starts in a previous cycle and ends in the next cycle (d=1), but the start is not at the end of the array.

Wait, perhaps the minimal subarray can be found by considering the prefix sums and looking for pairs (i, j) where j is in a later cycle than i, and the difference in their prefix sums plus the sum of the cycles in between equals the target.

But how to model this.

Another idea: For each possible starting index i in the original array, compute the cumulative sum until the end of the array. Then, for each possible number of full cycles d after that, compute how much more sum is needed, and see if adding d full cycles' sum plus some elements from the next cycle can reach the target.

But this might be computationally expensive.

Alternatively, for each possible starting index i in the original array, compute the sum from i to the end of the array (sum_remaining). Then, the required sum to reach target is target - sum_remaining. If this required sum is positive, then the number of full cycles d is required_sum // total_sum. But if total_sum is zero, this is a different case. But since all elements are positive (as per constraints, nums[i] >=1), total_sum is positive.

Wait, the constraints say 1 <= nums[i] <=1e5, so total_sum is at least len(nums) >=1. So total_sum is positive.

So for each i, sum_remaining is sum(nums[i:]). Then, the required_sum is target - sum_remaining. If required_sum <=0, then the subarray can be found within the current cycle. Otherwise, the number of full cycles is d = required_sum // total_sum. But wait, required_sum could be larger than d * total_sum, but perhaps we need to check for d and d+1.

Wait, perhaps for each i, we can compute how many full cycles are needed after the current position. For example, after i, the sum_remaining is sum(nums[i:]). Then, the required_sum is target - sum_remaining. If required_sum is negative, then the subarray is from i to some j in the current cycle. If required_sum is positive, then we need to add some full cycles and possibly some elements from the next cycle.

But how to model this.

Let me think of the example 2. For i=4 (the index of 3 in the original array), sum_remaining is 3 (since it's the last element). required_sum is 4-3=1. So we need to add 1 more. Since the total_sum is 8, the number of full cycles is 0 (since 1 <8). So we need to find elements after i in the next cycle. So the next element is 1 (the first element of the next cycle). So the sum is 3+1=4. The length is 2. So this is the correct case.

So for each i, we can compute the sum from i to the end of the array (sum_remaining). Then, the required_sum is target - sum_remaining. If required_sum is negative, then the subarray is in the current cycle. If required_sum is positive, then we need to add some full cycles and elements from the next cycle.

But how to compute the minimal length.

Let's formalize this:

For each i in 0..n-1:

sum_remaining = sum(nums[i:])

required_sum = target - sum_remaining

if required_sum <0:

   find the minimal j >=i such that sum(nums[i..j]) >= target. The minimal j-i+1 is the length.

else:

   d = required_sum // total_sum

   rem = required_sum % total_sum

   if rem ==0:

      d -=1

      rem = total_sum

   else:

      d = required_sum // total_sum

   So the number of full cycles is d, and we need to add rem elements from the next cycle.

   So the total length is (n - i) + d * n + (k), where k is the number of elements needed to get rem sum.

   But how to find k.

Wait, perhaps this approach is not correct. Let's think again.

For each i, the sum from i to the end of the array is sum_remaining. If sum_remaining >= target, then the minimal j is found in the current cycle. Otherwise, we need to add some full cycles and elements from the next cycle.

The required_sum is target - sum_remaining. Since sum_remaining < target, required_sum is positive.

The number of full cycles is d = required_sum // total_sum. But if required_sum is exactly divisible by total_sum, then d is (required_sum / total_sum) -1, and we need to take the entire next cycle. Otherwise, d is required_sum // total_sum, and we need to take rem = required_sum % total_sum elements from the next cycle.

Wait, for example, required_sum is 1, total_sum is 8. Then d=0, rem=1. So we need to take 1 element from the next cycle.

So the total length is (n - i) + 0 *n +1 = (n -i) +1.

In example 2, i=4 (n=5), sum_remaining=3. required_sum=1. d=0, rem=1. So length is (5-4) +0*5 +1=1+1=2. Which is correct.

So for each i, the minimal possible length is (n -i) + d *n + k, where k is the minimal number of elements needed to get rem sum. But how to compute k.

But how to find the minimal k such that the sum of the first k elements of nums is >= rem. Wait, no. Because rem is the required sum. So we need to find the minimal k where the sum of the first k elements of nums is >= rem. But since the elements are positive, the sum increases as k increases. So the minimal k is the smallest index where the prefix sum is >= rem.

So for each i, we can compute the required_sum, then compute d and rem. Then, find the minimal k where the prefix sum up to k is >= rem. Then the total length is (n -i) + d *n +k.

But how to compute this efficiently.

But for each i, this would take O(n) time, which is O(n^2) overall. Which is not feasible for n up to 1e5.

So this approach is not efficient enough.

Alternative idea: precompute the prefix sums of the original array. Then, for each i, compute sum_remaining = total_sum - prefix_sum[i]. Then required_sum = target - sum_remaining. If required_sum <=0, then find j in the current cycle. Else, compute d and rem. Then, find the minimal k where prefix_sum[k] >= rem. The total length is (n -i) + d *n +k.

But how to find k efficiently. For this, we can precompute the prefix sums and for each possible rem, find the minimal k using binary search.

Yes! So here's the plan:

1. Precompute the prefix sums of the original array. Let's call it prefix.

2. For each i in 0..n-1:

   a. sum_remaining = total_sum - prefix[i]

   b. required_sum = target - sum_remaining

   c. if required_sum <=0:

      i. Find the minimal j >=i such that prefix[j+1] - prefix[i] >= target. The length is j -i +1.

   d. else:

      i. d = required_sum // total_sum

      ii. rem = required_sum % total_sum

      iii. if rem ==0:

           d -=1

           rem = total_sum

      iv. Now, we need to find the minimal k where prefix[k] >= rem. The minimal k is the first index where prefix[k] >= rem.

      v. The total length is (n -i) + d *n + (k -0) (since the next cycle starts at 0 again). Wait, no. Because the next cycle's elements are nums[0], nums[1], etc. So the sum of the first k elements is prefix[k]. So the length is (n -i) (elements from i to end of current cycle) + d *n (full cycles) +k (elements from start of next cycle up to k-1). So the total length is (n -i) + d *n +k.

      vi. But we need to check if the sum of the first k elements is exactly rem. Because if it's larger, then the sum would be sum_remaining + d * total_sum + sum of first k elements. Which is sum_remaining + (d * total_sum) + sum_k. But sum_remaining + d * total_sum is sum_remaining + (required_sum // total_sum) * total_sum. But required_sum = target - sum_remaining. So sum_remaining + d * total_sum = target - sum_remaining + d * total_sum. Wait, this is getting complicated.

Wait, let's re-express:

sum_remaining = total_sum - prefix[i]

required_sum = target - sum_remaining

sum_remaining + d * total_sum + sum_k = target.

But sum_remaining + d * total_sum = (total_sum - prefix[i]) + d * total_sum = (d+1)*total_sum - prefix[i]

sum_k is the sum of the first k elements of nums, which is prefix[k].

So (d+1)*total_sum - prefix[i] + prefix[k] = target.

But required_sum = target - sum_remaining = target - (total_sum - prefix[i]) = target - total_sum + prefix[i]

So required_sum = target - total_sum + prefix[i]

But required_sum = d * total_sum + rem (from step d.i and d.ii)

So:

d * total_sum + rem = target - total_sum + prefix[i]

=> (d+1)*total_sum + rem = target + prefix[i]

But sum_remaining + d * total_sum + sum_k = (total_sum - prefix[i]) + d * total_sum + sum_k = (d+1)*total_sum - prefix[i] + sum_k.

We need this to equal target.

So:

(d+1)*total_sum - prefix[i] + sum_k = target

=> sum_k = target - (d+1)*total_sum + prefix[i]

But sum_k is the sum of the first k elements. So sum_k must be equal to rem, which is required_sum % total_sum. Wait, no. Because required_sum = d * total_sum + rem. So sum_k must be equal to rem. Because:

sum_remaining + d * total_sum + sum_k = sum_remaining + (d * total_sum) + sum_k = (total_sum - prefix[i]) + d * total_sum + sum_k = (d+1)*total_sum - prefix[i] + sum_k.

But required_sum = target - sum_remaining = target - (total_sum - prefix[i]) = target - total_sum + prefix[i]

So required_sum = d * total_sum + rem.

So:

d * total_sum + rem = target - total_sum + prefix[i]

=> (d+1)*total_sum + rem = target + prefix[i]

But sum_k is the sum of the first k elements. So sum_k must be equal to rem. Because:

sum_remaining + d * total_sum + sum_k = (total_sum - prefix[i]) + d * total_sum + sum_k = (d+1)*total_sum - prefix[i] + sum_k.

We need this to equal target. So:

(d+1)*total_sum - prefix[i] + sum_k = target.

But from the equation above, (d+1)*total_sum + rem = target + prefix[i]. So:

(d+1)*total_sum = target + prefix[i] - rem.

Substituting into the previous equation:

(target + prefix[i] - rem) - prefix[i] + sum_k = target.

=> target - rem + sum_k = target.

=> sum_k = rem.

So sum_k must be exactly rem. So we need to find the minimal k where prefix[k] >= rem. But if prefix[k] is exactly rem, then that's the minimal k. If not, then the sum would be larger than rem, which would make the total sum exceed the target. So this approach is not correct.

Wait, this suggests that the sum_k must be exactly rem. But how can we ensure that? Because the sum of the first k elements is prefix[k]. So we need to find a k where prefix[k] == rem. If there is no such k, then this approach won't work.

But in example 2, rem is 1. The prefix sums are [0,1,2,3,5,8]. So the first k where prefix[k] >=1 is k=1. prefix[1] is 1, which equals rem. So sum_k is 1. So the total sum is sum_remaining (3) + d*8 (0) +1=4. Which is correct.

But what if rem is not present in the prefix sums? For example, if rem is 2.5. Then there's no k where prefix[k] is exactly 2.5. So the sum would be larger than rem, leading to the total sum being sum_remaining + d*8 + sum_k =3 +0 +3=6, which is larger than target=4. So this approach would not work.

So this suggests that the approach is only valid when rem is present in the prefix sums. But how to handle cases where rem is not present.

This indicates that the approach is not correct. So perhaps the initial idea is flawed.

Alternative approach: For each i, compute the required_sum. Then, the number of full cycles is d = required_sum // total_sum. The remaining sum is rem = required_sum % total_sum. Then, we need to find a j in the next cycle such that the sum of the elements from the start of the next cycle up to j is rem. If rem is zero, then we need to take the entire next cycle. But since the elements are positive, rem can't be zero unless required_sum is a multiple of total_sum, but required_sum is target - sum_remaining. So if rem is zero, then required_sum is a multiple of total_sum, so d = required_sum / total_sum. But then, the sum of the next cycle is total_sum, which is equal to rem. So in this case, we need to take the entire next cycle. So the length is (n -i) + d *n +n = (n -i) + (d+1)*n. But d is required_sum / total_sum. For example, if required_sum is 8, total_sum is 8, then d=1, rem=0. So we need to take the entire next cycle. So the length is (n -i) + 1*n +n = (n -i) + 2n = 3n -i. But this may not be the minimal.

But this approach requires that rem is present in the prefix sums. So how to handle cases where rem is not present.

This suggests that the approach is not correct. So perhaps the initial idea is not the way to go.

Alternative idea: The minimal subarray can be found by considering all possible starting points in the original array and expanding to the right, possibly wrapping around multiple cycles. But this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

Another approach: Since the array is infinite, the minimal subarray must be either:

- Within the first cycle (d=0), or

- Starts in the first cycle and ends in the second cycle (d=1), or

- Starts in the first cycle and ends in the third cycle (d=2), etc.

But how to find the minimal length.

But for large d, the length would be large, so the minimal length is likely to be in d=0 or d=1.

So perhaps we can check for d=0 and d=1, and see if any of them gives a valid solution. If not, then there's no solution.

But this is not necessarily true. For example, if the target is very large, requiring multiple cycles. But given the constraints, the target can be up to 1e9, and the sum of the array can be up to 1e5 *1e5=1e10. So for target up to 1e9, the maximum possible d is 1e9 /1=1e9, which is not feasible to check.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea inspired by the two-pointer technique for subarray sum equals k:

But the array is circular and infinite. So perhaps we can model the problem using the prefix sums and modular arithmetic.

Let me think again about the prefix sums. For the infinite array, the prefix sum S[k] = (k //n)*total_sum + prefix[k%n].

We need to find two indices i < j such that S[j] - S[i] = target, and j -i is minimal.

So S[j] - S[i] = ( (j//n - i//n) * total_sum ) + (prefix[j%n] - prefix[i%n] ) = target.

Let d = j//n - i//n. So d >=0.

We can rewrite the equation as:

d * total_sum + (prefix[j%n] - prefix[i%n]) = target.

We need to find i and j such that this equation holds, and j -i is minimal.

But j can be written as (i//n +d)*n + j%n. So j = i + (d *n) + (j%n - i%n) if j%n >=i%n. Otherwise, j = i + (d+1)*n - (i%n - j%n).

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, for each possible d, we can look for pairs (i, j) in the original array's prefix sums such that prefix[j] - prefix[i] = target -d * total_sum. Then, the minimal j -i + d *n is a candidate for the minimal length.

But how to find the minimal j -i for each d.

But d can be up to (target // total_sum) +1. For example, if total_sum is 1 and target is 1e9, d can be up to 1e9. So this approach is not feasible.

But perhaps the minimal length is achieved when d is as small as possible. So we can check for d=0, d=1, etc., up to a certain limit, and see if any of them gives a valid solution.

But how to determine the limit for d.

For example, the minimal possible length for d=0 is j -i. For d=1, the minimal length is (j -i) +n. For d=2, (j -i) +2n, etc. So the minimal length is achieved when d is as small as possible.

So perhaps we can check for d=0, d=1, and d=2, and see if any of them gives a solution. If not, then there's no solution.

But this is not necessarily true. For example, if the minimal length is achieved with d=5, but we only check up to d=2, we'll miss it.

But given the time constraints, perhaps this is the only feasible approach.

So here's the plan:

1. Compute the prefix sums of the original array.

2. Check for d=0: find the minimal j -i where prefix[j] - prefix[i] = target. This is the standard subarray sum equals k problem, which can be solved in O(n) time using a hash map.

3. Check for d=1: find pairs (i, j) where prefix[j] - prefix[i] = target - total_sum. For each such pair, the length is (j -i) +n. The minimal such length is a candidate.

4. Check for d=2: find pairs where prefix[j] - prefix[i] = target - 2*total_sum. The length is (j -i) +2n. And so on.

But how many d's do we need to check?

The minimal possible length for d is (j -i) +d*n. To find the minimal possible, we need to find the minimal d where target -d*total_sum is achievable as a difference between two prefix sums.

But how to find the maximum d to check.

The maximum possible d is such that target -d*total_sum >= -prefix[n] (since the minimal prefix sum is 0, and the maximum difference is prefix[n] -0 = total_sum). So target -d*total_sum >= -total_sum. So d <= (target + total_sum) / total_sum. Which is d <= target//total_sum +1.

But for large target, this can be up to 1e9, which is not feasible.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: For each possible d, the required_diff is target -d*total_sum. We can compute this and check if there exists a pair (i, j) in the original array's prefix sums such that prefix[j] - prefix[i] = required_diff. For each such pair, the length is (j -i) +d*n. We need to find the minimal such length.

But how to find the minimal d for which required_diff is achievable.

But again, this is not feasible for large d.

So perhaps the correct approach is to consider all possible d where required_diff is in the range [ -total_sum, total_sum ].

Because the minimal difference between two prefix sums is 0 (if the same prefix sum exists) and the maximal is total_sum (prefix[n] - prefix[0] = total_sum).

So for required_diff to be in the range [ -total_sum, total_sum ], the possible d's are:

required_diff = target -d*total_sum.

So target -d*total_sum >= -total_sum → d <= (target + total_sum)/total_sum → d <= (target / total_sum) +1.

And target -d*total_sum <= total_sum → d >= (target - total_sum)/total_sum → d >= (target / total_sum) -1.

But since d is non-negative, the possible d's are in the range max(0, (target - total_sum)/total_sum) ) to (target + total_sum)/total_sum.

But for target up to 1e9 and total_sum up to 1e10, this range can be up to 1e9/1 +1 = 1e9+1, which is not feasible.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea inspired by the two-pointer technique for the original array:

For the original array, we can use a sliding window to find the minimal length subarray with sum >= target. But since the array is infinite, this approach is not directly applicable.

But perhaps the minimal subarray is either in the original array or wraps around once. So we can check for the minimal length in the original array and the minimal length that wraps around once.

But how to check for the wrapped case.

For the wrapped case, the subarray starts in the original array and ends in the next cycle. So the sum is sum_remaining (sum from i to end of array) + sum of some elements from the next cycle.

So for each i in 0..n-1:

sum_remaining = sum(nums[i:])

required_sum = target - sum_remaining

if required_sum <=0:

   find j in current cycle.

else:

   find the minimal k where the sum of the first k elements of nums is >= required_sum. The length is (n -i) +k.

The minimal of all these lengths is a candidate.

So the steps are:

1. Compute the prefix sums of the original array.

2. For each i in 0..n-1:

   a. sum_remaining = total_sum - prefix[i]

   b. required_sum = target - sum_remaining

   c. if required_sum <=0:

      i. find the minimal j >=i such that prefix[j+1] - prefix[i] >= target. The length is j -i +1.

   d. else:

      i. find the minimal k where prefix[k] >= required_sum. The length is (n -i) +k.

3. The minimal length from all these possibilities is the answer.

4. Also, check the case where the subarray is entirely within the original array (d=0).

But how to compute step 2d efficiently.

For step 2d, we can precompute the prefix sums and for each required_sum, perform a binary search to find the minimal k where prefix[k] >= required_sum.

This would take O(n log n) time.

So the overall time complexity is O(n log n), which is acceptable for n up to 1e5.

Let's test this approach on the examples.

Example 1:

nums = [1,2,3], target=5.

prefix = [0,1,3,6]

total_sum=6.

For each i:

i=0:

sum_remaining=6-0=6. required_sum=5-6= -1. So required_sum <=0.

Find j >=0 where prefix[j+1] -0 >=5. The prefix[j+1] >=5. The first j+1 where prefix[j+1] >=5 is j+1=3 (prefix[3]=6). So j=2. Length is 2-0+1=3.

i=1:

sum_remaining=6-1=5. required_sum=5-5=0. So required_sum <=0.

Find j >=1 where prefix[j+1] -1 >=5. prefix[j+1] >=6. j+1=3 → j=2. Length is 2-1+1=2.

i=2:

sum_remaining=6-3=3. required_sum=5-3=2. So required_sum>0.

Find k where prefix[k] >=2. The prefix is [0,1,3,6]. The minimal k is 2 (prefix[2]=3 >=2). So length is (3-2) +2=1+2=3.

i=3: not possible since i is up to n-1=2.

So the minimal length is 2.

Example 2:

nums = [1,1,1,2,3], target=4.

prefix = [0,1,2,3,5,8]

total_sum=8.

For each i:

i=0:

sum_remaining=8-0=8. required_sum=4-8= -4. So required_sum <=0.

Find j >=0 where prefix[j+1] -0 >=4. prefix[j+1] >=4. The first j+1 is 4 (prefix[4]=5). j=3. Length is 3-0+1=4.

i=1:

sum_remaining=8-1=7. required_sum=4-7= -3. required_sum <=0.

Find j >=1 where prefix[j+1] -1 >=4. prefix[j+1] >=5. j+1=4 → j=3. Length is 3-1+1=3.

i=2:

sum_remaining=8-2=6. required_sum=4-6= -2. required_sum <=0.

Find j >=2 where prefix[j+1] -2 >=4. prefix[j+1] >=6. j+1=5 → j=4. Length is 4-2+1=3.

i=3:

sum_remaining=8-3=5. required_sum=4-5= -1. required_sum <=0.

Find j >=3 where prefix[j+1] -3 >=4. prefix[j+1] >=7. j+1=5 → j=4. Length is 4-3+1=2.

i=4:

sum_remaining=8-8=0. required_sum=4-0=4. required_sum>0.

Find k where prefix[k] >=4. prefix is [0,1,2,3,5,8]. The minimal k is 4 (prefix[4]=5 >=4). So length is (5-4) +4=1+4=5.

So the minimal length is 2, which is correct.

Example 3:

nums = [2,4,6,8], target=3.

prefix = [0,2,6,12,20]

total_sum=20.

For each i:

i=0:

sum_remaining=20-0=20. required_sum=3-20= -17. required_sum <=0.

Find j >=0 where prefix[j+1] -0 >=3. prefix[j+1] >=3. j+1=1 (prefix[1]=2 <3), j+1=2 (6 >=3). j=1. Length is 1-0+1=2. But sum is 2, which is less than 3. Wait, no. The sum from i=0 to j=1 is 2+4=6 >=3. So the length is 2. But the sum is 6, which is larger than target. But the problem requires the sum to be exactly equal to target. So this approach is not correct.

Ah, here's the problem. The current approach for required_sum <=0 is to find a subarray in the current cycle with sum >= target. But the problem requires the sum to be exactly equal to target. So this approach is incorrect.

So the previous approach is flawed. Because it allows the sum to be >= target, but the problem requires it to be exactly equal.

So this approach is not correct. So I need to rethink.

So the problem requires the sum to be exactly equal to target. So the previous approach of finding a subarray with sum >= target is not correct. So this approach is invalid.

So this indicates that the initial idea is incorrect.

So back to the drawing board.

The correct approach must find a subarray whose sum is exactly equal to the target.

So for the case where required_sum <=0, we need to find a subarray in the current cycle that sums to exactly target. Not just >=.

So the previous approach is incorrect.

So this complicates things.

So the correct approach must:

For each i in 0..n-1:

sum_remaining = sum(nums[i:])

required_sum = target - sum_remaining.

If required_sum <=0:

   find j >=i such that sum(nums[i..j]) == target. The minimal j-i+1 is the length.

Else:

   find d and rem as before, and find j in the next cycle such that sum of the first k elements is rem. Then the total sum is sum_remaining + d*total_sum + sum_k = target.

But how to find j in the current cycle where sum(nums[i..j]) == target.

This requires that the sum of the subarray from i to j is exactly target.

But how to find this efficiently.

For the current cycle, the sum from i to j is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i]. So we need to find j >=i such that prefix[j+1] - prefix[i] == target.

This is similar to the standard subarray sum equals k problem, which can be solved using a hash map.

So for each i, we can check if (prefix[i] + target) exists in the prefix sums. If so, then j+1 is the index where prefix[j+1] = prefix[i] + target. The length is j+1 -i.

But this requires that the hash map contains all prefix sums up to j+1.

But since we are processing each i in order, we can maintain a hash map that stores the earliest occurrence of each prefix sum.

So here's the plan:

1. Compute the prefix sums of the original array.

2. For each i in 0..n-1:

   a. sum_remaining = total_sum - prefix[i]

   b. required_sum = target - sum_remaining.

   c. if required_sum <=0:

      i. We need to find j >=i such that prefix[j+1] - prefix[i] == target.

      ii. This is equivalent to finding a prefix[j+1] = prefix[i] + target.

      iii. Check if prefix[i] + target exists in the prefix sums, and the index j+1 is >=i+1.

      iv. If such j+1 exists, then the length is j+1 -i.

   d. else:

      i. Compute d and rem as before.

      ii. Check if there exists a k where prefix[k] == rem.

      iii. If such k exists, then the total length is (n -i) + d *n +k.

3. The minimal length from all possibilities is the answer.

But how to check for the existence of prefix[i] + target in the prefix sums.

We can precompute a hash map that maps each prefix sum to a list of indices where it occurs. Then, for each i, we can look up prefix[i] + target in the hash map and find the minimal j+1 >=i+1.

But this would require O(n) space and O(n) time to build the hash map.

Similarly, for the rem case, we need to check if rem exists in the prefix sums. If it does, then the minimal k is the first occurrence of rem.

So here's the revised approach:

1. Compute the prefix sums of the original array.

2. Create a hash map (dictionary) that maps each prefix sum to a list of indices where it occurs. Also, for each sum, keep track of the earliest and latest indices.

3. For each i in 0..n-1:

   a. sum_remaining = total_sum - prefix[i]

   b. required_sum = target - sum_remaining.

   c. if required_sum <=0:

      i. needed = prefix[i] + target.

      ii. If needed is in the hash map, find the minimal j+1 >=i+1 where prefix[j+1] == needed.

      iii. If such j+1 exists, the length is j+1 -i.

   d. else:

      i. d = required_sum // total_sum

      ii. rem = required_sum % total_sum

      iii. if rem ==0:

           d -=1

           rem = total_sum

      iv. Check if rem is in the prefix sums.

      v. If yes, then the minimal k is the first occurrence of rem.

      vi. The total length is (n -i) + d *n +k.

4. The minimal length from all possibilities is the answer.

But this approach may not work for all cases. Let's test it on example 3.

Example 3:

nums = [2,4,6,8], target=3.

prefix = [0,2,6,12,20]

hash map:

0: [0]

2: [1]

6: [2]

12: [3]

20: [4]

For each i:

i=0:

sum_remaining=20-0=20. required_sum=3-20= -17. required_sum <=0.

needed =0 +3=3. 3 is not in the hash map. So no solution.

i=1:

sum_remaining=20-2=18. required_sum=3-18= -15. needed=2+3=5. Not in hash map.

i=2:

sum_remaining=20-6=14. required_sum=3-14= -11. needed=6+3=9. Not in hash map.

i=3:

sum_remaining=20-12=8. required_sum=3-8= -5. needed=12+3=15. Not in hash map.

So no solution in the current cycle.

For the else case:

required_sum=3.

d=3//20=0. rem=3.

Check if rem=3 is in the prefix sums. No. So no solution.

So the answer is -1. Which is correct.

Another test case: example 2.

i=3:

sum_remaining=8-3=5. required_sum=4-5= -1. needed=3+4=7. Not in the hash map.

But in the else case:

required_sum=4.

d=4//8=0. rem=4.

Check if rem=4 is in the prefix sums. The prefix sums are [0,1,2,3,5,8]. 4 is not present. So no solution.

But the correct answer is achieved in the else case for i=4.

Wait, i=4:

sum_remaining=8-8=0. required_sum=4-0=4.

d=4//8=0. rem=4.

Check if rem=4 is in the prefix sums. No. So no solution.

But the correct answer is achieved by taking i=4 and k=1 (sum of first 1 element is 1). But according to the approach, rem=4 is not in the prefix sums, so this case is not considered.

So this approach is not correct.

So what's wrong here?

In example 2, the required_sum is 4. d=0, rem=4. But the sum of the first k elements is 1 (k=1), which is less than rem. So the sum_remaining + d*8 + sum_k =0 +0 +1=1, which is not equal to target. So this approach is not considering the case where the sum of the first k elements is greater than rem.

But the problem requires the sum to be exactly equal to target. So the approach is correct in not considering this case.

But in example 2, the correct answer is achieved by taking i=4 (element 3) and k=1 (element 1 from the next cycle). The sum is 3+1=4. So sum_remaining is 3 (sum from i=4 to end of array is 3). required_sum=4-3=1. So d=0, rem=1. So check if rem=1 is in the prefix sums. Yes, at index 1. So k=1. The total length is (5-4) +0*5 +1=1+0+1=2. Which is correct.

So for i=4:

sum_remaining=3. required_sum=1.

d=0, rem=1.

Check if rem=1 is in the prefix sums. Yes, at index 1. So k=1.

So the total length is (5-4) +0*5 +1=2.

So this case is handled correctly.

So the approach is correct.

So the steps are:

For each i:

sum_remaining = total_sum - prefix[i]

required_sum = target - sum_remaining.

If required_sum <=0:

   needed = prefix[i] + target.

   Check if needed exists in the prefix sums. If yes, and the index j+1 is >=i+1, then the length is j+1 -i.

Else:

   d = required_sum // total_sum

   rem = required_sum % total_sum

   if rem ==0:

      d -=1

      rem = total_sum

   Check if rem exists in the prefix sums. If yes, then the length is (n -i) + d *n +k, where k is the first occurrence of rem.

So the code needs to:

- Precompute the prefix sums.

- Create a hash map that maps each prefix sum to a list of indices where it occurs. For each sum, we can store the earliest index to minimize the length.

- For each i, compute sum_remaining and required_sum.

- For required_sum <=0, check if needed exists in the hash map and find the earliest j+1 >=i+1.

- For required_sum >0, compute d and rem, check if rem exists in the hash map, and compute the length.

So the code can be structured as follows:

First, compute the prefix sums.

Then, build a hash map (dictionary) that maps each prefix sum to a list of indices. For each sum, we can store the earliest index to minimize the length.

But to find the earliest j+1 >=i+1, we can binary search the list of indices for the sum.

Alternatively, for each sum, we can store the list of indices in sorted order, and for a given i, perform a binary search to find the first index >=i+1.

So the code steps:

1. Compute the prefix sums.

2. Create a dictionary, say prefix_map, where each key is a prefix sum, and the value is a list of indices where this sum occurs, sorted in increasing order.

3. For each i in 0 to n-1:

   a. sum_remaining = total_sum - prefix[i]

   b. required_sum = target - sum_remaining

   c. if required_sum <=0:

      i. needed = prefix[i] + target

      ii. if needed not in prefix_map: continue

      iii. indices = prefix_map[needed]

      iv. use binary search to find the first index in indices that is >=i+1.

      v. if such an index exists (j+1), then the length is j+1 -i.

   d. else:

      i. d = required_sum // total_sum

      ii. rem = required_sum % total_sum

      iii. if rem ==0:

           d -=1

           rem = total_sum

      iv. if rem not in prefix_map: continue

      v. k = prefix_map[rem][0]  # earliest occurrence of rem

      vi. length = (n -i) + d *n +k

   e. keep track of the minimal length.

4. Also, check the case where the subarray is entirely within the original array (d=0). This is covered in the required_sum <=0 case.

5. If no valid subarray is found, return -1.

So the code needs to handle these steps.

Now, let's implement this in Python.

But how to handle the binary search for the indices.

In Python, the bisect module can be used. For example, bisect_left can find the insertion point of i+1 in the list of indices. If the insertion point is within the list, then the index is present.

So for step 3c.iv:

import bisect

indices = prefix_map.get(needed, [])

pos = bisect.bisect_left(indices, i+1)

if pos < len(indices):

   j_plus_1 = indices[pos]

   length = j_plus_1 -i

Else:

   no solution.

Similarly, for the rem case, we need to check if rem is in the prefix_map. If yes, then the earliest k is the first occurrence of rem.

So the code can be written as follows.

Now, let's test this approach on example 2.

Example 2:

prefix = [0,1,2,3,5,8]

prefix_map:

0: [0]

1: [1]

2: [2]

3: [3]

5: [4]

8: [5]

For i=4 (prefix[i] =8):

sum_remaining =8-8=0.

required_sum=4-0=4.

d=4//8=0.

rem=4%8=4.

rem is not in the prefix_map. So no solution.

But wait, the correct case is when i=4, required_sum=1.

Wait, no. For i=4, sum_remaining is sum(nums[4:]) =3. required_sum=4-3=1.

So d=0, rem=1.

rem is in the prefix_map at index 1.

So k=1.

length = (5-4) +0*5 +1=1+0+1=2.

So the code would find this.

So for i=4:

sum_remaining=3.

required_sum=1.

d=0.

rem=1.

rem is in the prefix_map. k=1.

length=1+0+1=2.

So the code would find this.

So the code works.

Another example: example 1.

i=1:

sum_remaining=6-1=5.

required_sum=5-5=0.

needed=1+5=6.

prefix_map[6] is [3].

i+1=2.

bisect_left([3], 2) returns 0. So j_plus_1=3.

length=3-1=2.

Which is correct.

So the code works.

Now, let's implement this.

The code steps:

- Compute the prefix sums.

- Build the prefix_map.

- Iterate over each i.

- For each i, compute sum_remaining and required_sum.

- Handle the two cases.

Now, the code:

We need to import List from typing.

The code:

class Solution:
    def minSizeSubarray(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        prefix = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + nums[i]
        total_sum = prefix[-1]
        prefix_map = defaultdict(list)
        for idx, s in enumerate(prefix):
            prefix_map[s].append(idx)
        min_length = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n):
            sum_remaining = total_sum - prefix[i]
            required_sum = target - sum_remaining
            if required_sum <= 0:
                needed = prefix[i] + target
                if needed not in prefix_map:
                    continue
                indices = prefix_map[needed]
                # Find the first index >= i+1
                pos = bisect.bisect_left(indices, i+1)
                if pos < len(indices):
                    j_plus_1 = indices[pos]
                    min_length = min(min_length, j_plus_1 - i)
            else:
                d = required_sum // total_sum
                rem = required_sum % total_sum
                if rem == 0:
                    d -= 1
                    rem = total_sum
                if rem not in prefix_map:
                    continue
                k = prefix_map[rem][0]
                length = (n - i) + d * n + k
                min_length = min(min_length, length)
        
        return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1

But wait, in the else case, when rem is not zero, we need to check if rem is in the prefix_map. If yes, then k is the first occurrence of rem.

But what if rem is zero? For example, if required_sum is a multiple of total_sum. For example, required_sum=8, total_sum=8. Then d=1, rem=0. So we set d=0, rem=8. Then check if 8 is in the prefix_map. If yes, then k is the first occurrence of 8. Which is prefix[5] in example 2.

But in example 2, when i=0, sum_remaining=8, required_sum=4-8= -4. So required_sum <=0. needed=0+4=4. Not in the prefix_map. So no solution.

But if required_sum is 8, then d=1, rem=0. So rem is set to 8. Check if 8 is in the prefix_map. Yes, at index 5. So k=5. The length is (n -i) +d*n +k =5-0 +1*5 +5=5+5+5=15. Which is not minimal.

But this is a valid case.

So the code handles this.

But what about when rem is zero and the prefix_map has zero? For example, if required_sum is 0, then d=0, rem=0. So rem is set to total_sum. But if total_sum is zero, but the problem states that nums[i] >=1, so total_sum is at least 1. So rem=total_sum.

But this case is handled.

So the code should work.

Now, let's test the code on example 2.

Example 2:

i=4:

sum_remaining=3.

required_sum=1.

d=0.

rem=1.

prefix_map[1] is [1].

k=1.

length= (5-4) +0*5 +1=1+0+1=2.

Which is correct.

So the code returns 2.

Another test case: example 3.

No solution, so returns -1.

Example 1:

returns 2.

So the code should work.

Now, let's think about possible edge cases.

Edge case where the subarray is exactly the entire array.

For example, nums = [1,2,3], target=6. The sum is 6. So the minimal length is 3.

The code would find this in the required_sum <=0 case.

i=0:

sum_remaining=6-0=6.

required_sum=6-6=0.

needed=0+6=6. prefix_map[6] is [3]. i+1=1. bisect_left([3],1) is 0. j_plus_1=3. length=3-0=3.

Which is correct.

Another edge case: nums = [1], target=1. The minimal length is 1.

The code would find this.

i=0:

sum_remaining=1-0=1.

required_sum=1-1=0.

needed=0+1=1. prefix_map[1] is [1]. i+1=1. bisect_left([1],1) is 0. j_plus_1=1. length=1-0=1.

Correct.

Another edge case: nums = [1, -1, 5], but wait, the problem states that nums[i] >=1. So this is not allowed.

So all elements are positive.

Another edge case: target is achieved by wrapping around once.

For example, nums = [3,1,2], target=4.

sum is 6.

i=0:

sum_remaining=6-0=6. required_sum=4-6= -2. needed=0+4=4. prefix_map has 4? No. So no solution.

i=1:

sum_remaining=6-3=3. required_sum=4-3=1.

d=0. rem=1.

prefix_map[1] is [1]. k=1.

length= (3-1) +0*3 +1=2+0+1=3.

i=2:

sum_remaining=6-6=0. required_sum=4-0=4.

d=0. rem=4. Not in prefix_map.

But the correct answer is 2: the subarray [3,1] in the next cycle. sum is 3+1=4. So i=0, sum_remaining=6. required_sum=4-6= -2. needed=0+4=4. Not in prefix_map. So no solution.

But the correct answer is achieved by i=0, required_sum=4-6= -2. So required_sum <=0. needed=0+4=4. Not in prefix_map. So no solution.

But the correct answer is 2. So this case is not handled by the code.

Wait, what's wrong here.

The target is 4. The subarray is [3,1] which is in the next cycle. So the sum is 3 (from first cycle) +1 (from second cycle) =4.

So sum_remaining for i=0 is 6. required_sum=4-6= -2. So required_sum <=0. needed=0+4=4. Not in the prefix_map. So the code does not find this.

But the sum of the subarray is 3+1=4. So the code is missing this case.

So why?

Because the code is only considering subarrays that start in the current cycle and end in the same or later cycles. But in this case, the subarray starts in the first cycle and ends in the second cycle. But the code's approach for required_sum <=0 is to find a subarray in the current cycle. But in this case, the required_sum is negative, so the code is looking for a subarray in the current cycle. But the correct subarray is not in the current cycle.

So the code is missing this case.

So the approach is incorrect.

This indicates that the code is not handling cases where the subarray wraps around multiple cycles.

So the code is not correct.

This is a problem.

So what's the issue here?

The code's approach for required_sum <=0 is to find a subarray in the current cycle. But in this case, the required_sum is negative, which means that the sum of the current cycle's remaining elements is larger than the target. So the code is looking for a subarray in the current cycle that sums to exactly target. But the correct subarray is not in the current cycle.

So the code is missing this case.

So the approach is incorrect.

So how to handle this case.

This suggests that the code's approach is not sufficient.

So the problem is that the code is not considering the case where the subarray wraps around multiple cycles and the required_sum is negative.

So the code is missing this case.

So how to handle this.

Alternative idea: For required_sum <=0, we need to consider not only the current cycle but also the possibility of wrapping around.

But how.

For example, in the case where required_sum is negative, the sum of the current cycle's remaining elements is larger than the target. So the subarray could start in the current cycle and end in the next cycle.

But how to model this.

This is getting very complicated.

So perhaps the correct approach is to consider all possible d's, but this is not feasible for large d.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the code can be modified to also consider the case where required_sum is negative and d= -1.

But this is not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should also consider the case where required_sum is negative and d= -1.

But d is the number of full cycles after the current cycle. So d can be negative.

But how.

Alternatively, for required_sum <=0, we can compute d = (required_sum) // total_sum. But since required_sum is negative, d can be negative.

For example, required_sum = -2, total_sum=6. d = -2 //6 = -1.

rem = required_sum %6 =4.

So required_sum = d * total_sum + rem → -2 = -1*6 +4 → -2 =-6+4 → -2=-2. Correct.

So for required_sum <=0, we can compute d and rem as follows:

d = required_sum // total_sum

rem = required_sum % total_sum

But since required_sum is negative, d can be negative.

Then, the required_diff is rem.

So for required_sum <=0, we can compute d and rem, and check if rem exists in the prefix_map.

But this would allow us to find subarrays that wrap around.

So the code can be modified to handle this case.

So the revised approach is:

For each i:

sum_remaining = total_sum - prefix[i]

required_sum = target - sum_remaining

if required_sum <=0:

   d = required_sum // total_sum

   rem = required_sum % total_sum

   if rem ==0:

       d -=1

       rem = total_sum

   if rem not in prefix_map:

       continue

   k = prefix_map[rem][0]

   length = (n -i) + d *n +k

else:

   ... (same as before)

But this would allow us to find subarrays that wrap around.

Let's test this on the previous example.

Example where nums = [3,1,2], target=4.

prefix = [0,3,4,6]

total_sum=6.

For i=0:

sum_remaining=6-0=6.

required_sum=4-6= -2.

d = -2 //6 = -1.

rem = -2 %6 =4.

So rem=4.

Check if 4 is in the prefix_map. Yes, at index 2.

k=2.

length = (3-0) + (-1)*3 +2 =3 -3 +2=2.

Which is correct.

So the code would find this.

So the code needs to be modified to handle this case.

So the revised code would:

For each i:

sum_remaining = total_sum - prefix[i]

required_sum = target - sum_remaining

if required_sum <=0:

   d = required_sum // total_sum

   rem = required_sum % total_sum

   if rem ==0:

       d -=1

       rem = total_sum

   if rem not in prefix_map:

       continue

   k = prefix_map[rem][0]

   length = (n -i) + d *n +k

else:

   ... (same as before)

But this would allow us to find subarrays that wrap around.

So the code needs to be modified to handle this.

So the code would now handle the case where required_sum is negative and the subarray wraps around.

So the code would now be:

class Solution:
    def minSizeSubarray(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        prefix = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + nums[i]
        total_sum = prefix[-1]
        prefix_map = defaultdict(list)
        for idx, s in enumerate(prefix):
            prefix_map[s].append(idx)
        min_length = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n):
            sum_remaining = total_sum - prefix[i]
            required_sum = target - sum_remaining
            if required_sum <= 0:
                d = required_sum // total_sum
                rem = required_sum % total_sum
                if rem == 0:
                    d -= 1
                    rem = total_sum
                if rem not in prefix_map:
                    continue
                k = prefix_map[rem][0]
                length = (n - i) + d * n + k
                min_length = min(min_length, length)
            else:
                d = required_sum // total_sum
                rem = required_sum % total_sum
                if rem == 0:
                    d -= 1
                    rem = total_sum
                if rem not in prefix_map:
                    continue
                k = prefix_map[rem][0]
                length = (n - i) + d * n + k
                min_length = min(min_length, length)
        
        return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1

Wait, but this code would handle both cases (required_sum <=0 and required_sum >0) in the same way. But this is not correct. Because for required_sum >0, the code is using the same logic as for required_sum <=0.

But in the previous approach, for required_sum >0, the code computed d and rem as required_sum = d*total_sum + rem, and then checked if rem is in the prefix_map.

But for required_sum <=0, the code now computes d and rem as required_sum = d*total_sum + rem, and then checks if rem is in the prefix_map.

But this may not be correct.

For example, in the case where required_sum is negative, the code computes d and rem, and then checks if rem is in the prefix_map. But the required_sum is negative, so d is negative.

But the code is now handling both cases in the same way.

So the code can be simplified to:

For each i:

sum_remaining = total_sum - prefix[i]

required_sum = target - sum_remaining

compute d and rem as required_sum = d*total_sum + rem.

if rem is in the prefix_map:

   compute the length.

But how to compute d and rem correctly.

But required_sum can be positive or negative.

So the code can compute d and rem as:

d
