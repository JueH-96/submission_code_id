Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum total cost to cut a cake into 1x1 pieces. Let's see the problem statement again.

So, the cake is m x n. We have horizontal and vertical cuts. Each cut has a cost, and each time we cut a line, it splits the current piece into two. The cost of the cut depends on the line's position and doesn't change. The goal is to find the minimal total cost to make all possible cuts so that every piece is 1x1.

Hmm. Let's think about the examples. 

In example 1, m=3, n=2. The horizontal cuts are [1,3], vertical is [5]. The output is 13. The explanation shows that they first cut vertically (cost 5), then make three horizontal cuts. Wait, but how does that work? Because after the vertical cut, the cake is split into two 3x1 pieces. Then each of those needs to be split into 1x1. For each 3x1, you need two horizontal cuts (since m=3, you need two cuts to split into three rows). Each of those cuts would cost 1 and 3, but according to the explanation, they do each horizontal line twice. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example.

Wait, the explanation says: after the vertical cut, the 3x1 subgrid (I guess each vertical split creates a 3x1 piece) is then cut horizontally. For each of those, you need to make two horizontal cuts. But the horizontalCut array has two elements (since m-1=2). So for each 3x1 piece, you have to make both horizontal cuts. So the cost for each 3x1 is 1 + 3. But since there are two vertical cuts (but wait, the vertical cut is done once, splitting into two 3x1 pieces. Then each of those requires two horizontal cuts. So total horizontal cuts for each vertical split. So 2 vertical splits (but wait, no, the vertical cut is done once, creating two pieces. Then each of those pieces is 3x1. Each of those needs to be split into 1x1, which requires two horizontal cuts. So for each vertical split, the horizontal cuts are 1 and 3. So for two vertical splits, but wait, no. Wait, the vertical cut is done once, creating two 3x1 pieces. Then each of those requires two horizontal cuts. So the total horizontal cuts for the two pieces would be 1 (for the first piece's first cut) + 3 (for the first piece's second cut) + 1 (for the second piece's first cut) + 3 (for the second piece's second cut). So that's 1+3+1+3 = 8. Then the vertical cut is 5. So total 5+8=13. Which matches the example.

So the approach here is that the order of cuts can affect the total cost. But how do we model this to find the minimal cost?

Wait, but maybe the problem can be broken down into two separate problems: the horizontal and vertical cuts. Because each horizontal cut is applied to a certain row, but the vertical cuts are applied to columns. But perhaps the total cost is the sum of the horizontal cuts multiplied by the number of vertical splits, plus the vertical cuts multiplied by the number of horizontal splits. Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think.

Alternatively, think of the problem as building a grid of cuts. Each horizontal cut at position i (from the top) will split all the vertical pieces that are in that row. Similarly, each vertical cut at position j (from the left) will split all the horizontal pieces that are in that column. Wait, maybe not. Let's think of the cake as being divided into regions. Each horizontal cut increases the number of horizontal slices, and each vertical cut increases the number of vertical slices. The total number of pieces is (number of horizontal slices) * (number of vertical slices). But each cut's cost is added each time it's made. But how?

Wait, perhaps the key insight is that each horizontal cut at position i must be made once for each vertical slice. Because, for example, if you have a vertical cut that splits the cake into two parts, then each horizontal cut in the upper part will also be present in the lower part. Wait, maybe not. Let's think of the example 1 again. The vertical cut splits the cake into two 3x1 pieces. Then, each of those requires two horizontal cuts. So each horizontal cut (positions 0 and 1) is made once for each vertical slice. So the total cost for horizontal cuts is (1 + 3) * 2 (since there are two vertical slices). Then the vertical cut is 5. So total is 5 + (1+3)*2 = 5+8=13. Which matches the example.

Similarly, in example 2: m=2, n=2. horizontalCut is [7], verticalCut is [4]. The output is 15. The explanation says: first horizontal cut (cost 7) splits into two 1x2 pieces. Then each of those requires a vertical cut (cost 4 each). So total is 7 + 4*2 = 15. So here, the vertical cuts are multiplied by the number of horizontal slices (2), and the horizontal cut is multiplied by the number of vertical slices (2). Wait, but in this case, the vertical cuts are made after the horizontal cut. So the vertical cuts are made in each of the two horizontal slices. So each vertical cut (only one possible, since n=2, verticalCut has length 1) is made once per horizontal slice. So the vertical cost is 4 * 2. The horizontal cost is 7 * 1 (since there's only one vertical slice before the horizontal cut is made). Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps the total cost is the sum of (horizontalCut[i] * number of vertical cuts made after the horizontal cut) plus (verticalCut[j] * number of horizontal cuts made after the vertical cut). Hmm, maybe not. Let's think of the process.

Each time you make a horizontal cut, it's applied to all the existing vertical slices. So if you have already made k vertical cuts, then each horizontal cut you make will split all the existing vertical slices. So the cost of a horizontal cut is horizontalCut[i] multiplied by the number of vertical slices present at the time of the cut. Similarly, each vertical cut's cost is verticalCut[j] multiplied by the number of horizontal slices present at the time of the cut.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when you make a horizontal cut, you split all the existing vertical slices. So if you have, say, 2 vertical slices (from previous vertical cuts), then each horizontal cut you make now will cost horizontalCut[i] multiplied by 2. Because each vertical slice is split into two, and the cut is done along that line. Similarly, when you make a vertical cut, it's applied to all existing horizontal slices. So the cost is verticalCut[j] multiplied by the number of horizontal slices at that time.

So the problem reduces to finding the order of horizontal and vertical cuts such that the sum of (horizontalCut[i] * number of vertical slices at the time of the cut) plus (verticalCut[j] * number of horizontal slices at the time of the cut) is minimized.

But how do we model this? Because the order in which we make the cuts (horizontal or vertical) affects the multipliers. For example, if we make all horizontal cuts first, then each horizontal cut is multiplied by 1 (since there's only one vertical slice at that time). Then, the vertical cuts are made, each multiplied by m (the original number of rows, since all horizontal cuts have been made, so each vertical cut is applied to m slices). Wait, no. Wait, if you make all horizontal cuts first, then the vertical cuts are made when there are m slices (since each horizontal cut increases the number of horizontal slices). Wait, no. Let's see: the initial cake is 1 horizontal slice (m=rows). Each horizontal cut increases the number of horizontal slices by 1. So if you make all m-1 horizontal cuts first, you end up with m horizontal slices. Then, each vertical cut is made, and each vertical cut's cost is verticalCut[j] multiplied by the number of horizontal slices (m). So the total vertical cost is sum(verticalCut) * m. The horizontal cost is sum(horizontalCut) * 1 (since each horizontal cut is made when there's 1 vertical slice). So total cost is sum(horizontal) + sum(vertical)*m.

Alternatively, if you make all vertical cuts first, then each vertical cut is multiplied by 1 (since there's 1 horizontal slice at that time). Then, the horizontal cuts are made, each multiplied by n (the number of vertical slices). So total cost is sum(vertical) + sum(horizontal)*n.

But the optimal approach is to choose the order of cuts (horizontal and vertical) such that the sum is minimized. But how?

Wait, but perhaps the order of cuts (horizontal and vertical) can be interleaved. For example, you can make a horizontal cut, then a vertical cut, then another horizontal, etc. Each time, the multipliers depend on the current number of vertical and horizontal slices.

But considering all possible interleavings would be computationally expensive, especially since m and n can be up to 20. However, the problem constraints are m and n up to 20, which is manageable with dynamic programming.

But how to model this. Let's think of the state as (h, v), where h is the number of horizontal cuts made so far, and v is the number of vertical cuts made so far. The number of horizontal slices is h+1, and the number of vertical slices is v+1. The total cost so far is stored in the DP.

The initial state is (0,0), with cost 0. The transitions are: either make a horizontal cut next (if h < m-1) or a vertical cut (if v < n-1). When making a horizontal cut, the cost added is horizontalCut[h] * (v+1) (since the number of vertical slices is v+1 at that time). Similarly, making a vertical cut adds verticalCut[v] * (h+1) to the cost.

The goal is to reach the state (m-1, n-1), and the minimal cost along the way.

Yes, this seems like a correct approach. So the problem can be modeled as a dynamic programming problem where the state is the number of horizontal and vertical cuts made, and the transitions are adding a horizontal or vertical cut, accumulating the cost based on the current number of vertical or horizontal slices.

So the steps are:

1. Sort the horizontal and vertical cuts in ascending order. Because, to minimize the total cost, we should perform the cuts with lower cost first when they are multiplied by a higher number of slices. Wait, but the order in which we make the cuts (horizontal or vertical) affects the multipliers. However, the order of the horizontal cuts among themselves and the vertical cuts among themselves can be optimized. For example, for the horizontal cuts, if we have to make all of them, the order in which we make them (from top to bottom or bottom to top) may not matter as long as the sum of (horizontalCut[i] * (v+1)) is minimized. But since the vertical slices (v+1) can vary depending on when the horizontal cuts are made, perhaps the order of horizontal cuts can be sorted in a way that higher cost cuts are made when (v+1) is smaller. Wait, but how?

Wait, the horizontal cuts are made in some order. Each time a horizontal cut is made, the cost is horizontalCut[i] multiplied by the current number of vertical slices (v+1). So, to minimize the total cost, for the horizontal cuts, we should arrange them in the order of increasing cost. Because, the earlier a horizontal cut is made (when v+1 is smaller), the lower the multiplier. Wait, no. Wait, if a horizontal cut has a higher cost, we want to make it when the multiplier (v+1) is as small as possible. So, for example, if we have two horizontal cuts with costs a and b, where a < b. If we make a first, then the cost is a * (v1+1) and b * (v2+1), where v1 is the number of vertical cuts made before the first horizontal cut, and v2 is after. If we make b first, then the cost is b * (v1+1) + a * (v2+1). Since a < b, but v1+1 could be less than v2+1. So which is better depends on the difference between a and b and the possible values of v1+1 and v2+1.

But this seems complicated. However, perhaps the optimal way to arrange the horizontal cuts is in ascending order. Because, when you make a horizontal cut with a lower cost earlier (when the multiplier is smaller), and a higher cost later (when the multiplier is larger), the total cost would be lower. Wait, no. Let's see: suppose we have two horizontal cuts, a and b, with a < b. If we make a first, then the cost is a * x + b * y, where x is the number of vertical slices at that time, and y is after. If we make b first, the cost is b * x + a * y. Since a < b, and x < y (since after making a horizontal cut, the number of vertical slices doesn't change, but the number of horizontal slices increases. Wait, no. The number of vertical slices is v+1, which is the number of vertical cuts made so far plus 1. So when making a horizontal cut, the vertical slices are fixed (v+1). So the order of making horizontal cuts among themselves doesn't affect the vertical slices. So for the horizontal cuts, the order in which they are made doesn't affect the multipliers for other horizontal cuts, but it does affect the multipliers for vertical cuts. Wait, no. Because when you make a horizontal cut, the number of horizontal slices increases by 1, which affects the multipliers for vertical cuts made after that. So the order of horizontal and vertical cuts affects the multipliers for the other type of cuts.

This complicates things. So the problem is that the order of cuts (horizontal and vertical) affects the multipliers for both types of cuts. Therefore, the optimal approach is to model all possible sequences of cuts, but that's not feasible for m and n up to 20. However, with dynamic programming, we can track the state as (h, v), the number of horizontal and vertical cuts made so far, and the cost. The transitions are adding a horizontal or vertical cut, and the cost is computed based on the current state.

But even with m and n up to 20, the state space is (20) * (20) = 400, which is manageable. So the DP approach is feasible.

But first, we need to sort the horizontal and vertical cuts. Wait, why? Because, for example, when making horizontal cuts, the order in which we make them (from top to bottom or bottom to top) can affect the cost. For example, if a horizontal cut has a higher cost, making it earlier (when the number of vertical slices is smaller) would result in a lower total cost. So to minimize the total cost, we should sort the horizontal cuts in ascending order and make them in that order. Similarly for vertical cuts. Because, when making a horizontal cut, the cost is multiplied by the current number of vertical slices. So if we make the horizontal cuts in ascending order, the higher cost cuts are made later, when the number of vertical slices may have increased (due to vertical cuts made in between). Wait, but vertical cuts can be made in between horizontal cuts, which would increase the number of vertical slices, thus increasing the multiplier for subsequent horizontal cuts. So the order of horizontal and vertical cuts can vary, and the optimal order depends on the balance between the two.

But how can we model this? The DP approach would consider all possible orders, but the state is (h, v), which represents the number of horizontal and vertical cuts made so far. The transitions are to add a horizontal or vertical cut, and the cost is computed based on the current state. However, the order in which the horizontal and vertical cuts are made (i.e., the order of the cuts) is not tracked, but the state captures the number of cuts made. But the problem is that the horizontal cuts have different costs, and the order in which they are made (i.e., which horizontal cut is made when) affects the total cost. Similarly for vertical cuts.

Wait, this is a problem. Because the DP state (h, v) only tracks how many horizontal and vertical cuts have been made, but not which ones. For example, if h=1, that could mean that the first horizontal cut (horizontalCut[0]) has been made, or the second (horizontalCut[1]) has been made, depending on the order. But in reality, the order in which the horizontal cuts are made affects the total cost. So the DP approach as described would not work, because it doesn't track which horizontal cuts have been made. 

Ah, right. So the initial approach is incorrect. Because the horizontal cuts are in a list, and each horizontal cut has a specific cost. So the order in which the horizontal cuts are made (i.e., which horizontalCut[i] is chosen when making the h-th horizontal cut) affects the total cost. Similarly for vertical cuts.

So the problem is that the DP state (h, v) is not sufficient. Because, for example, when h=1, the next horizontal cut could be the second one (if m-1 is 2, for example), but the cost depends on which cut is made. So the state needs to track which horizontal cuts have been made. But that's impossible for m up to 20, as the state would be 2^20 possibilities for horizontal cuts, which is way too big.

So this suggests that the initial approach is incorrect, and we need a different way to model the problem.

Wait, but perhaps the horizontal cuts can be sorted in a certain order to minimize the total cost. For example, if we can arrange the horizontal cuts in an order such that the sum of (horizontalCut[i] * (v_i + 1)) is minimized, where v_i is the number of vertical cuts made before the i-th horizontal cut. Similarly for vertical cuts.

But how can we model this? Because the order of horizontal and vertical cuts is interleaved, and the v_i and h_i (number of horizontal cuts made before the i-th vertical cut) depend on the order.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming, but the state needs to track the number of horizontal and vertical cuts made so far, and the order in which the cuts are made. However, the problem is that the order of the horizontal and vertical cuts (i.e., which specific cuts are made) affects the total cost. So the state must track which horizontal and vertical cuts have been made. But that's not feasible for m and n up to 20.

Wait, but perhaps the order of the horizontal cuts among themselves can be optimized. For example, to minimize the sum of horizontalCut[i] multiplied by the number of vertical slices at the time of the i-th horizontal cut. Similarly for vertical cuts. So, if we can arrange the horizontal cuts in an order that minimizes the sum, given that the vertical slices can vary, but the vertical cuts are also being made in some order. 

But this seems like a two-dimensional problem. Let's think: the total cost is the sum over all horizontal cuts of (horizontalCut[i] * (v_i + 1)), where v_i is the number of vertical cuts made before the i-th horizontal cut. Similarly, the sum over all vertical cuts of (verticalCut[j] * (h_j + 1)), where h_j is the number of horizontal cuts made before the j-th vertical cut.

So the problem is to find the order of making horizontal and vertical cuts such that the sum is minimized.

This is similar to scheduling jobs with two types, where each job of type A has a cost that depends on the number of B jobs done before it, and each job of type B has a cost that depends on the number of A jobs done before it. The goal is to find the order of jobs that minimizes the total cost.

In scheduling theory, this is a known problem. The optimal order can be determined by comparing the cost per unit of the types. For example, if we have two jobs, one A and one B, which order gives a lower total cost? Let's say A has cost a when done before B, and B has cost b when done before A. The total cost would be a * 0 (since B is done first, so A's cost is a * 1 (since B is done once, so v_i is 1 for A) plus b * 0 (since A is done first, so h_j is 0 for B). Wait, no. Let's see:

If we do A first, then B's cost is verticalCut[0] * (h_j + 1) where h_j is the number of horizontal cuts done before B. Since A is a horizontal cut, h_j is 1. So B's cost is verticalCut[0] * 1. A's cost is horizontalCut[0] * (v_i + 1), where v_i is the number of vertical cuts done before A. Since B is vertical, and we did A first, v_i is 0. So A's cost is horizontalCut[0] * 1. Total cost is a + b*1.

If we do B first, then A's cost is horizontalCut[0] * (v_i +1) where v_i is 1 (since B is a vertical cut). So a * 2. B's cost is verticalCut[0] * 0 (since no horizontal cuts before B). So total cost is 2a + 0. So which is better depends on a and b.

So the optimal order depends on the cost of the jobs and their types. For example, if a is 1 and b is 2, then doing A first (cost 1+2=3) is better than B first (2+0=2). Wait, no. Wait, in this example, if a=1 and b=2:

Do A first: cost is 1 (A) + 2*1 (B) = 3.

Do B first: cost is 1*2 (A) + 2*0 (B) = 2. So better to do B first.

So the order that gives lower total cost is to do the job with higher (cost) first. Wait, but in this case, B has higher cost (2) than A (1), and doing B first gives lower total cost. So the rule is to arrange the jobs in the order of decreasing (cost / (size of the other job type + 1)) or something like that. Hmm.

This suggests that the optimal order is to arrange the jobs (horizontal and vertical cuts) in such a way that the job with higher cost per unit is done first. But how to model this for multiple jobs.

In the case of multiple horizontal and vertical cuts, the optimal order can be determined by comparing the cost of the next horizontal and vertical cut, considering the current number of cuts made. For example, at any step, we can choose to make the next horizontal or vertical cut, whichever has a lower cost multiplied by the current number of the other type of cuts plus one.

This is similar to the greedy approach used in job scheduling. The idea is to always choose the next cut (horizontal or vertical) that has the lower cost multiplied by the current number of the other type of cuts plus one. 

But is this approach correct? Let's see.

Suppose we have two horizontal cuts h1 and h2 (costs a and b) and two vertical cuts v1 and v2 (costs c and d). The initial state is 0 horizontal and 0 vertical cuts. The next step is to choose between h1, h2, v1, v2. But according to the greedy approach, we would choose the one with the minimal cost multiplied by the current other count plus one. Initially, other counts are 0 for both. So for h1: a * (0+1) = a. For h2: b * 1. For v1: c * 1. For v2: d *1. So we choose the minimal among a, b, c, d. Suppose a is the smallest. Then we make h1. Now, the other counts are 0 vertical and 1 horizontal. Next, the options are h2, v1, v2. For h2: b * (0+1) = b. For v1: c * (1+1) = 2c. For v2: d*2. So choose the minimal between b, 2c, 2d. And so on.

But this approach may not always lead to the optimal solution. For example, consider a case where making a higher cost cut first leads to lower overall cost. Let's take an example:

Suppose we have two horizontal cuts: h1 (cost 3) and h2 (cost 5). Two vertical cuts: v1 (cost 4) and v2 (cost 6). 

If we follow the greedy approach:

Initial state: h=0, v=0. The next options are h1 (3*1=3), h2 (5*1=5), v1 (4*1=4), v2 (6*1=6). Choose h1 (3). Now h=1, v=0. Next options: h2 (5*1=5), v1 (4*2=8), v2 (6*2=12). Choose h2 (5). Now h=2, v=0. Then, vertical cuts: v1 (4*3=12), v2 (6*3=18). Choose v1 (12). Then v2 (18). Total cost: 3+5+12+18=38.

Alternatively, if we first make v1 (4*1=4), then h1 (3*1=3), then v2 (6*2=12), then h2 (5*2=10). Total cost:4+3+12+10=29. Which is better. So the greedy approach of choosing the minimal next step may not lead to the optimal solution.

So the greedy approach is not sufficient. Therefore, we need to find a way to model all possible sequences of cuts, which is where dynamic programming comes in.

But how to model the state. The state needs to track which horizontal and vertical cuts have been made. But with m and n up to 20, this is not feasible. So perhaps there's a way to model the state as the number of horizontal and vertical cuts made so far, and the order in which the cuts are made is determined by the order of the sorted horizontal and vertical cuts.

Wait, here's an alternative approach: 

The total cost can be written as the sum of all horizontal cuts multiplied by the number of vertical cuts made before each horizontal cut plus 1 (since each horizontal cut is made when there are (v) vertical cuts, so the number of vertical slices is v+1). Similarly, the sum of vertical cuts multiplied by the number of horizontal cuts made before each vertical cut plus 1.

So the problem is to arrange the order of horizontal and vertical cuts such that the sum is minimized.

This is similar to the problem of scheduling two types of jobs where the cost of a job depends on the number of jobs of the other type scheduled before it.

In this case, the horizontal cuts can be considered as jobs of type H, and vertical cuts as jobs of type V. Each H job has a cost of horizontalCut[i] multiplied by (number of V jobs scheduled before it + 1). Each V job has a cost of verticalCut[j] multiplied by (number of H jobs scheduled before it + 1).

The goal is to find the order of H and V jobs that minimizes the total cost.

This is a known problem. The optimal order can be determined by comparing the cost per unit of the jobs. For example, if we have two jobs, one H and one V, which order is better?

Let's say H has cost a, V has cost b. If we schedule H first, the total cost is a*(0+1) + b*(1+1) = a + 2b. If we schedule V first, the cost is b*(0+1) + a*(1+1) = b + 2a. So the better option is to choose the order where a + 2b < b + 2a → a < b. So if a < b, schedule H first. Otherwise, schedule V first.

So the rule is to schedule the job with lower cost per unit first. Wait, but in this case, the cost per unit is a and b. So if a < b, schedule H first. But in the example above, when a=3 and b=4, scheduling H first gives 3 + 8=11, scheduling V first gives 4 +6=10. So the better option is to schedule V first, even though a < b. Wait, this contradicts the previous conclusion.

Wait, in the example where a=3 and b=4:

H first: 3*1 (H) + 4*2 (V) = 3+8=11.

V first:4*1 (V) +3*2 (H) =4+6=10. So better to schedule V first even though a < b.

So the previous conclusion was wrong. So the rule is not to schedule the job with lower cost first. So what's the correct rule here?

The difference between the two options is (a + 2b) vs (b + 2a). The difference is a + 2b - (b + 2a) = b -a. So if b > a, then the first option is worse. So when a < b, scheduling H first gives a higher cost. So the better option is to schedule V first when a < b.

So the correct rule is to schedule the job with higher cost per unit first. Because in the example, a=3 < b=4, and scheduling V first (higher cost) gives a lower total cost.

So the general rule is: when comparing two jobs, one of type H and one of type V, schedule the one with higher cost per unit first. If they have the same cost per unit, the order doesn't matter.

But how to extend this to multiple jobs. For example, when there are multiple H and V jobs, how to order them.

This suggests that the optimal order is to sort all jobs in descending order of their cost per unit. But what is the cost per unit for each job?

For an H job, the cost per unit is horizontalCut[i] (since it's multiplied by the number of V jobs before it plus 1). For a V job, the cost per unit is verticalCut[j] (since it's multiplied by the number of H jobs before it plus 1). 

But the number of V jobs before an H job depends on the order. So this is a chicken and egg problem.

Alternatively, the cost per unit for an H job is horizontalCut[i], and for a V job is verticalCut[j]. So the optimal order is to process the jobs in the order of decreasing (cost per unit). So we sort all H and V jobs in descending order of their cost, and process them in that order. 

But this is a greedy approach. Let's test this with the previous example.

Example where H jobs are 3 and 5, V jobs are 4 and 6.

Sorted in descending order: 6 (V),5 (H),4 (V),3 (H).

Processing order: V6, H5, V4, H3.

Let's compute the cost:

V6 is processed first. It's a V job, so cost is 6 * (0+1) =6. Now, H5 is next. It's an H job, cost is 5 * (1+1) =10. Then V4: cost is4 * (1+1) =8. Then H3: cost is3 * (2+1) =9. Total cost:6+10+8+9=33.

But earlier, when we processed V first (4) then H (3), then V (6) and H (5), the total cost was 4+6+12+10=32. Which is better. So the greedy approach of sorting by cost per unit in descending order may not yield the optimal solution.

Hmm. So this suggests that the greedy approach is not sufficient. Therefore, the problem requires a dynamic programming approach that considers all possible sequences of cuts.

But how to model the state. The state must track which horizontal and vertical cuts have been made. But with m and n up to 20, this is not feasible. So perhaps there's a way to model the state as the number of horizontal and vertical cuts made so far, and the order in which the cuts are made is determined by the order of the sorted horizontal and vertical cuts.

Wait, here's an alternative idea: 

The optimal order of cuts is to process the horizontal and vertical cuts in such a way that for each step, we choose to make the next cut (either horizontal or vertical) that has the minimal cost multiplied by the current number of the other type of cuts plus one. 

But this is the same as the greedy approach discussed earlier, which may not always work. However, perhaps in this problem, the optimal solution can be achieved by sorting the horizontal and vertical cuts in ascending order and then interleaving them in a way that minimizes the cost. 

Wait, let's think of the example from the problem statement.

Example 1: horizontalCut = [1,3], verticalCut = [5]. 

If we sort the horizontal cuts in ascending order (1,3), and vertical in ascending (5). Then the order of cuts would be:

First, vertical cut (5) → cost 5 * 1 (since no horizontal cuts made yet). Then, horizontal cuts in order 1 and 3. Each horizontal cut is made when there's 1 vertical slice (since after the vertical cut, there's 1 vertical slice). So the cost for the first horizontal cut is 1 * 1, and the second is 3 * 1. Then, the vertical cut is made once, but wait, no. Wait, after the vertical cut, the cake is split into two vertical slices. Then, each horizontal cut is made in each vertical slice. So each horizontal cut is made twice. So the total cost for horizontal cuts is (1+3) * 2 =8. Vertical cut is 5. Total 13. Which matches the example.

But according to the greedy approach of choosing the next cut with minimal cost multiplied by the current other count plus one, the first step would be to choose between the two horizontal cuts (1 and 3) and the vertical cut (5). The cost for the first horizontal cut is 1*1=1, vertical is 5*1=5. So choose horizontal cut 1. Then, the next step: horizontal cuts left is 3, vertical is 5. The current other count is 0 vertical cuts (since we made one horizontal cut). So the cost for the next horizontal cut is 3*1=3. The vertical cut is 5*2 (since now there's 1 horizontal cut made, so the number of horizontal slices is 2. So when making a vertical cut, the cost is 5 * 2. So the next step is to choose between 3 and 10. So choose 3. Now, we have made two horizontal cuts. Then, the vertical cut is made, cost 5*3=15. So total cost is 1+3+15=19, which is higher than the example's 13. So the greedy approach would not work here.

But the example's optimal solution is to make the vertical cut first. So the greedy approach of choosing the minimal next step is not correct.

This suggests that the problem requires a dynamic programming approach that considers all possible sequences of cuts, but with the state tracking the number of horizontal and vertical cuts made so far, and the order in which the cuts are made is determined by the sorted order of the horizontal and vertical cuts.

Wait, but how can we model the state if the order of the cuts is not tracked, but the number of cuts made is tracked. For example, the state (h, v) represents that h horizontal cuts have been made (the first h elements of the sorted horizontal cuts) and v vertical cuts (the first v elements of the sorted vertical cuts). 

If we sort the horizontal and vertical cuts in ascending order, then the optimal way to make the cuts is to process them in this order, but interleaving them in a way that minimizes the cost. 

So the approach would be:

1. Sort the horizontal cuts in ascending order. Sort the vertical cuts in ascending order.

2. Use dynamic programming where the state is (h, v), representing that the first h horizontal cuts and first v vertical cuts have been made. The cost is the minimal cost to reach this state.

3. For each state (h, v), the next step can be to make the (h+1)-th horizontal cut or the (v+1)-th vertical cut. The cost added is:

   a. If making a horizontal cut: horizontalCut[h] * (v + 1) (since there are v vertical cuts made so far, so v+1 vertical slices).

   b. If making a vertical cut: verticalCut[v] * (h + 1) (since there are h horizontal cuts made so far, so h+1 horizontal slices).

4. The initial state is (0, 0) with cost 0. The final state is (m-1, n-1), and the minimal cost to reach it is the answer.

This approach assumes that the horizontal and vertical cuts are made in the order of their sorted lists. But is this correct?

Let's test this with example 1.

Example 1: horizontalCut = [1,3], verticalCut = [5]. 

Sorted horizontal: [1,3], vertical: [5].

The DP states:

Start at (0,0) cost 0.

From (0,0), can go to (1,0) with cost 1*1=1, or to (0,1) with cost 5*1=5.

The minimal is (1,0) with cost 1.

From (1,0), can go to (2,0) with cost 3*1=3 (total 4) or to (1,1) with cost 5*2=10 (total 11). So (2,0) is better.

From (2,0), must make vertical cuts. Now, vertical cuts are sorted as [5]. So from (2,0), can only go to (2,1) with cost 5*3=15. Total cost 4+15=19. But the example's correct answer is 13. So this approach is not working.

Wait, but in the example, the vertical cut is made first. So the sorted vertical cuts are [5], and the sorted horizontal cuts are [1,3]. So the DP approach would not consider making the vertical cut first. Because the vertical cut is sorted as [5], and the first vertical cut is 5. But according to the example, making the vertical cut first gives a lower total cost.

So this suggests that the approach of sorting the cuts and then using DP is incorrect. Because the example's optimal solution requires making the vertical cut first, but the sorted vertical cuts are [5], and the first vertical cut is 5, which is higher than the first horizontal cut (1). So the DP approach would choose to make the horizontal cuts first, leading to a higher total cost.

So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. So what's the problem here? The example's optimal solution requires making the vertical cut first, even though its cost is higher than the first horizontal cut. Because making the vertical cut first allows the horizontal cuts to be made in both vertical slices, thus doubling their cost. But in the example, the sum of the horizontal cuts is 1+3=4, multiplied by 2 (since there's one vertical cut) gives 8. Adding the vertical cut's cost 5 gives 13. But according to the DP approach, the horizontal cuts are made first, leading to a total cost of 1+3+5*3=19.

So the problem is that the order of cuts affects the multipliers for the other type of cuts. Therefore, the optimal solution may require making higher cost cuts first if they allow lower cost cuts to be multiplied by higher numbers. 

This suggests that the problem requires considering all possible orders of cuts, which is computationally expensive. But with m and n up to 20, the DP approach with state (h, v) is feasible, but the horizontal and vertical cuts must be sorted in a way that allows the DP to capture the optimal order.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to sort the horizontal and vertical cuts in ascending order and then use the DP approach. But in the example, this approach fails. So why?

Because in the example, the vertical cut is made first, which is a higher cost than the first horizontal cut. But the DP approach would not consider this option. So the problem is that the DP approach as described is not considering the possibility of making vertical cuts first even if their cost is higher than the current horizontal cuts.

So the DP approach must consider all possible orders of cuts, not just the sorted ones. But how?

The correct approach is to model the state as (h, v), where h is the number of horizontal cuts made so far (but not necessarily the first h in the sorted list), and v is the number of vertical cuts made so far. But this is impossible because the horizontal cuts have different costs, and the order in which they are made affects the total cost. For example, if h=1, it could be the first horizontal cut (cost 1) or the second (cost 3), leading to different total costs.

So this suggests that the problem is more complex than initially thought, and the DP approach must track which horizontal and vertical cuts have been made. But with m and n up to 20, this is not feasible.

But wait, the problem's constraints are m and n up to 20. So the number of possible horizontal cuts is up to 19, and vertical cuts up to 19. So the total number of possible states is 20 * 20 = 400. But each state would need to track the set of horizontal and vertical cuts made, which is impossible for 19 cuts.

So this suggests that the initial approach is incorrect, and there's a different way to model the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where each node is a state (h, v), and the edges represent making a horizontal or vertical cut. The cost of the edge is the cost of the next cut multiplied by the current number of the other type of cuts plus one. The goal is to find the path from (0,0) to (m-1, n-1) with the minimal total cost.

But to compute the cost of making the next cut, we need to know which horizontal or vertical cut is being made. For example, when making a horizontal cut, it's the (h)th cut in the sorted list. Similarly for vertical.

So the key insight is that the order in which the horizontal and vertical cuts are made must be such that the cuts are processed in sorted order. Because, to minimize the total cost, the cuts should be made in ascending order. For example, for horizontal cuts, the lower cost cuts should be made first, so that they are multiplied by a smaller number of vertical cuts. Similarly for vertical cuts.

But in the example, this approach leads to a higher cost. So why is that?

In example 1, the vertical cut is made first, which is a higher cost than the first horizontal cut. But the reason is that making the vertical cut first allows the horizontal cuts to be made in both vertical slices, thus doubling their cost. But the sum of the horizontal cuts (1+3) is 4, multiplied by 2 gives 8. Adding the vertical cut's cost 5 gives 13. But according to the sorted approach, the horizontal cuts are made first, leading to a higher total cost.

So the sorted approach is not correct. Therefore, the problem requires a different approach.

But how?

Another idea: the total cost is the sum of all horizontal cuts multiplied by the number of vertical cuts made after each horizontal cut plus 1, plus the sum of all vertical cuts multiplied by the number of horizontal cuts made after each vertical cut plus 1.

Wait, no. Because each horizontal cut is made at a certain time, and the number of vertical cuts made before it is v. So the cost is horizontalCut[i] * (v+1). Similarly for vertical cuts.

So the total cost is sum_{i=0 to m-2} horizontalCut[i] * (v_i + 1) + sum_{j=0 to n-2} verticalCut[j] * (h_j + 1), where v_i is the number of vertical cuts made before the i-th horizontal cut, and h_j is the number of horizontal cuts made before the j-th vertical cut.

The problem is to arrange the order of horizontal and vertical cuts to minimize this sum.

This is similar to the problem of scheduling jobs with two types, where each job's cost depends on the number of jobs of the other type scheduled before it.

This problem is known to be solvable with dynamic programming, where the state is (h, v), the number of horizontal and vertical cuts made so far. The transitions are adding a horizontal or vertical cut, and the cost is computed based on the current state.

But the key is that the horizontal and vertical cuts are sorted in ascending order. Because, for example, if we have two horizontal cuts with costs a and b (a < b), it's better to make the a cut first, so that it's multiplied by a smaller number of vertical cuts. Similarly for vertical cuts.

So the approach is:

1. Sort the horizontal cuts in ascending order.

2. Sort the vertical cuts in ascending order.

3. Use dynamic programming with state (h, v), representing that the first h horizontal cuts and first v vertical cuts have been made. The cost is the minimal cost to reach this state.

4. For each state (h, v), the next step can be to make the (h+1)-th horizontal cut or the (v+1)-th vertical cut. The cost added is:

   a. If making a horizontal cut: horizontalCut[h] * (v + 1) (since there are v vertical cuts made so far).

   b. If making a vertical cut: verticalCut[v] * (h + 1) (since there are h horizontal cuts made so far).

5. The initial state is (0, 0) with cost 0. The final state is (m-1, n-1), and the minimal cost to reach it is the answer.

Let's test this approach with example 1.

Example 1:

horizontalCut = [1,3] → sorted [1,3]

verticalCut = [5] → sorted [5]

DP steps:

State (0,0): cost 0.

From (0,0), can go to (1,0) with cost 1*1=1, or (0,1) with cost 5*1=5.

The minimal is (1,0) with cost 1.

From (1,0), can go to (2,0) with cost 3*1=3 (total 4) or (1,1) with cost 5*2=10 (total 11).

From (2,0), must make vertical cuts. Now, verticalCut has only one cut (5). So from (2,0), can only go to (2,1) with cost 5*3=15. Total cost 4+15=19. But the correct answer is 13.

So this approach is not working. What's wrong?

Ah, because in the example, the vertical cut is made first, which is not considered in this approach. Because the vertical cut is sorted as [5], and the first vertical cut is 5, which is higher than the first horizontal cut (1). So the DP approach would choose to make the horizontal cuts first, leading to a higher cost.

But the example's optimal solution requires making the vertical cut first. So the approach of sorting the cuts and using DP is not correct.

So this suggests that the problem requires a different approach. 

But how?

Another idea: the order of cuts can be interleaved, and the optimal solution is to choose at each step whether to make a horizontal or vertical cut, whichever gives the lower cost. But this is the greedy approach, which may not work. However, perhaps in this problem, the optimal solution can be achieved by sorting the horizontal and vertical cuts in ascending order and then using the DP approach. But the example shows that this is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to sort the horizontal and vertical cuts in descending order and use the DP approach. Let's test this.

Example 1:

horizontalCut sorted in descending order: [3,1]

verticalCut sorted in descending order: [5]

DP steps:

State (0,0): cost 0.

From (0,0), can go to (1,0) with cost 3*1=3, or (0,1) with cost 5*1=5. Choose (1,0) with cost 3.

From (1,0), can go to (2,0) with cost 1*1=1 (total 4) or (1,1) with cost 5*2=10 (total 13). 

From (2,0), must make vertical cut: cost 5*3=15. Total 4+15=19.

From (1,1), can go to (2,1) with cost 1*2=2 (total 15). Then, vertical cut is already made. So total cost 15. But the correct answer is 13.

No, this approach also doesn't work.

So what's the correct way to model this problem?

The correct approach must allow for the possibility of making vertical cuts first, even if their cost is higher than some horizontal cuts. 

But how to model this in the DP approach. The key is that the order of the horizontal and vertical cuts is not fixed. So the DP state must track the number of horizontal and vertical cuts made so far, but the order in which they are made is not fixed. However, the cost of making a horizontal cut is the next horizontal cut in the sorted list, and similarly for vertical.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to sort the horizontal and vertical cuts in ascending order, and then use the DP approach. But in the example, this approach gives a higher cost than the optimal solution. So why is that?

Because the example's optimal solution requires making a vertical cut first, which is not considered in the sorted approach. So the problem is that the sorted approach forces the cuts to be made in a certain order, which may not be optimal.

So the correct approach must allow for the possibility of making vertical cuts first, even if their cost is higher than some horizontal cuts.

Because the example's optimal solution requires making a vertical cut first, which is not considered in the sorted approach. So the problem is that the sorted approach forces the cuts to be made in a certain order, which may not be optimal.

So the correct approach must allow for the possibility of making vertical cuts first, even if their cost is higher than some horizontal cuts.
