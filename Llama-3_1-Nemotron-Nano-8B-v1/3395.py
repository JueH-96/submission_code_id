Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum possible length of the string t, given that s is a concatenation of anagrams of t. Hmm. So, s is made by putting together multiple copies of an anagram of t. Wait, but each part is an anagram of t. So, for example, if t is "ab", then possible anagrams are "ab" and "ba". So s could be "abab" (two copies of "ab") or "baab" (a copy of "ba" followed by a copy of "ab"), etc. But the key is that each substring that is part of the concatenation must be an anagram of t. 

The goal is to find the smallest possible t's length. So, how do we approach this?

Let me think. The minimum possible length of t would be such that the entire string s can be divided into parts, each of which is an anagram of t, and t is as small as possible. 

So, for example, in the first example, s is "abba". The output is 2. The explanation says t could be "ba". So the concatenation is "ab" (anagram of "ba") followed by "ba" (another anagram). So each part is length 2, and t is length 2. 

In the second example, s is "cdef", which is already an anagram of itself (since it's length 4), so the minimum t is 4.

So the problem reduces to finding the smallest possible divisor d of the length of s, such that the entire string can be divided into k parts (each of length d), and each part is an anagram of the first part (since all parts are anagrams of t, which is the same for all). 

Wait, but t is the same for all parts. So each part must be an anagram of t. So, the first part's character counts must match t's, the second part's counts must also match t's, etc. So, the entire s's character counts would be k times the counts of t. Because each part contributes the same counts as t. 

So, for example, if s has a total count of each character as C, then each part (each anagram of t) must have counts C_i, where C_i * k = C. So, the counts for each character in t must be C_i = C / k. But since k is the number of parts, and each part is length d, then the total length of s is d * k. So, the total length of s is len(s) = d * k. 

So, the approach is to find all possible divisors d of len(s), such that d is a possible candidate for the length of t. Then, for each possible d (divisor of len(s)), check if the entire s can be divided into parts of length d, each of which is an anagram of the first part. The smallest such d is the answer.

But how do we find the possible divisors d? Well, the possible d's are the divisors of the length of s. For example, if len(s) is 4, the possible d's are 1, 2, 4. But we need to check each possible d in increasing order, and return the smallest one that works. Because once we find the smallest d that satisfies the condition, that's the answer.

So the steps are:

1. Compute the total character counts of s. Let's call this total_counts.

2. For each possible d that divides the length of s (starting from the smallest possible), check if for each character in total_counts, the count is divisible by (len(s)/d). Because len(s) is d * k, so k is len(s)/d. Then, each part must have count (total_counts[c] / k) for each character c. But since each part is an anagram of t, the counts in each part must be exactly the same. So, for each character, total_counts[c] must be divisible by k. Because k is len(s)/d. So, for a given d, k = len(s) // d. Then, for each character c, total_counts[c] must be divisible by k. If that's the case, then it's possible that each part has the same counts, which would make them anagrams of each other (and thus of t). 

Wait, but even if the total counts are divisible by k, the actual substrings of length d must have the same counts. Because it's possible that the total counts are divisible by k, but the way the characters are arranged in the string s makes it impossible to split into k parts each with the required counts. 

For example, suppose s is "aabb", len(s) is 4. Let's say d=2. Then k=2. The total counts are a:2, b:2. So each part must have a:1, b:1. The first two characters are "aa" (counts a:2, b:0) which is not acceptable. So even though the total counts are divisible by k, the actual split may not work. 

So, the initial check (total counts divisible by k) is necessary but not sufficient. So, even if that condition is met, we need to verify that the actual splits of the string into parts of length d all have the same character counts as the first part. 

So the steps would be:

For each possible d (divisors of len(s), in increasing order):

   k = len(s) // d

   Check if for all characters c in total_counts, total_counts[c] is divisible by k. If not, skip this d.

   Then, check if the first part (the first d characters) has counts that, when multiplied by k, equal the total counts. Because each part must have the same counts as the first part. 

   Then, check that every part in the string (split into k parts of length d) has the same counts as the first part. 

   If all these conditions are met, then return d as the answer.

So, the algorithm is:

1. Compute the total character counts of s.

2. Generate all possible divisors d of len(s) in increasing order.

3. For each d:

   a. Compute k = len(s) // d.

   b. Check if for all characters c, total_counts[c] is divisible by k. If not, skip.

   c. Compute the expected count for each character in t: expected = total_counts[c] // k.

   d. Check that the sum of expected counts is equal to d. Because each t has length d, so sum(expected.values()) must be d.

   e. Then, split the string into k parts of length d. For each part, compute its character counts and check if it matches the expected counts. If all parts match, then return d.

4. The first d (smallest) that satisfies all these conditions is the answer.

But how to generate the divisors of len(s) in increasing order?

Well, the divisors of len(s) can be found by checking all numbers from 1 to sqrt(len(s)), and for each divisor found, add both the divisor and len(s)/divisor. Then, collect all unique divisors, sort them, and iterate from smallest to largest.

But for the problem, since we need to check the smallest possible d first, we can generate the divisors in sorted order.

But for len(s) up to 1e5, this is manageable.

So, for example, len(s) is 4. The divisors are 1, 2, 4. So check d=1 first. Then d=2, then d=4.

But for d=1, k=4. The total counts must be divisible by 4. For example, in the first example, s is "abba", len(s)=4. The total counts are a:2, b:2. For d=1, k=4. So each part (each character) must have counts a:0.5, b:0.5, which is impossible. So d=1 is invalid.

Then check d=2. k=2. The total counts are a:2, b:2. Each part must have a:1, b:1. The first part is "ab" (counts a:1, b:1). Then the second part is "ba" (counts b:1, a:1). So all parts match. So d=2 is valid. So return 2.

So the algorithm would work.

Now, the steps in code:

First, compute the total character counts. Then, generate all possible divisors of len(s) in increasing order. For each d, check the conditions.

But how to generate the divisors in order?

Let's think. For a number n, the divisors can be found by checking up to sqrt(n). For each i from 1 to sqrt(n), if i divides n, then add i and n/i to the list. Then, after collecting all divisors, sort them and remove duplicates. Then, iterate from the smallest to largest.

But for the problem, since we need to check the smallest possible d first, we can generate the divisors in sorted order.

So, code for generating divisors:

n = len(s)

divisors = set()

for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) +1):

    if n % i == 0:

        divisors.add(i)

        divisors.add(n//i)

divisors = sorted(divisors)

Then, iterate through the divisors in order.

But wait, the divisors are sorted in increasing order. So for example, for n=4, the divisors would be [1,2,4].

So, in code, after generating the set, we sort it, and then loop through each d in the sorted list.

Now, for each d in the sorted list of divisors:

Check if the total counts for each character is divisible by k = n//d.

If not, skip.

Then, compute the expected counts for each character (total_counts[c] // k).

Check that the sum of expected counts is equal to d. Because each t has length d.

If not, skip.

Then, split the string into k parts of length d. For each part, compute the character counts and check if it matches the expected counts.

If all parts match, return d.

So, the code steps:

Compute total_counts as a Counter(s).

Then, for each d in sorted divisors:

    k = len(s) // d

    # Check if all counts are divisible by k

    valid = True

    for c in total_counts:

        if total_counts[c] % k != 0:

            valid = False

            break

    if not valid:

        continue

    # Compute expected counts

    expected = {c: total_counts[c] // k for c in total_counts}

    # Check sum of expected is d

    if sum(expected.values()) != d:

        continue

    # Now split the string into k parts of length d

    # For each part, check if counts match expected

    # Also, check that each part is of length d

    # But since d is a divisor, len(s) is k*d, so each part is exactly d.

    # So, split the string into parts.

    # For efficiency, perhaps check the first part, then check the rest.

    # Because if the first part's counts don't match expected, then it's invalid.

    # Then, check the rest.

    # But for the problem, perhaps the first part's counts must match expected, and all other parts must also match.

    # So, first, check the first part.

    first_part = s[0:d]

    first_counts = Counter(first_part)

    if first_counts != expected:

        continue

    # Then, check the rest of the parts.

    # For each part from 1 to k-1:

    # start = i*d, end = (i+1)*d

    # part = s[start:end]

    # check counts.

    # But for large k (like 1e5), this could be O(n) time, which is acceptable since the total steps are O(n) for all divisors.

    # But for len(s) up to 1e5, and for each d, the code could be O(n) time. But the number of divisors is O(sqrt(n)), so total time is O(n*sqrt(n)), which for n=1e5 is 1e5 * 300 (since sqrt(1e5) is ~316) → 3e7 operations, which is acceptable.

    # But perhaps we can optimize.

    # Since the total counts are divisible by k, and the first part's counts are expected, then the sum of all parts' counts would be k * expected, which equals the total counts. So, if all parts except the first have the same counts as expected, then the total would be correct. But that's not sufficient. So, we need to check all parts.

    # So, for each part in the string:

    for i in range(1, k):

        start = i * d

        end = start + d

        part = s[start:end]

        part_counts = Counter(part)

        if part_counts != expected:

            valid = False

            break

    if valid:

        return d

So, the code would proceed like that.

But for very large k (like when d is 1, k is 1e5), this would take O(k) time, which is O(1e5) steps. But for each d, the code could take O(n) time. So, in the worst case, for a string of length 1e5, and for each d (up to 1e5 divisors), this could be O(n^2) time, which is not acceptable.

Wait, but the number of divisors of a number up to 1e5 is at most 100 (for example, 1e5 has divisors 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, 625, 1000, 1250, 2500, 3125, 5000, 6250, 12500, 25000, 50000, 100000). Wait, no, 1e5 is 100000. Let's see: 100000 factors into 2^5 * 5^5. The number of divisors is (5+1)*(5+1) = 36. So for 1e5, there are 36 divisors. So for each d in 36 divisors, the code would process O(n) steps. So 36 * 1e5 = 3.6e6 steps, which is acceptable.

But for the code to be efficient, perhaps we can find a way to check the parts without processing each part in O(d) time. For example, using a sliding window approach.

But for the problem, perhaps the code as described is acceptable.

But let's think about the example where d is 1. Then, each part is a single character. The expected counts for each character would be total_counts[c] / k. But since k is len(s) (since d=1), the expected counts would be total_counts[c] / len(s). Which is only possible if each character's count is exactly len(s) (since len(s) is the sum of all counts). So, for example, if s is "aaaaa", then len(s) is 5. d=1, k=5. The expected count for 'a' is 5/5=1. So each part (each character) must be 'a'. So the code would check that each character is 'a', which is the case. So d=1 is valid, and the answer is 1.

But in this case, the code would split the string into 5 parts of length 1, each 'a', and check each part's counts. So for each part, the code would create a Counter, which for a single character is O(1) time. So for 5 parts, it's O(5) time.

But for a string of length 1e5, and d=1, the code would check 1e5 parts, each of which is a single character. So the code would take O(1e5) time for that d. But since d=1 is the first candidate, the code would return 1 immediately if it's valid.

But in the worst case, for a string that requires the maximum possible d (the entire string), the code would check all divisors up to that d. For example, if the string is "abc", then the divisors are 1,3. For d=1, the code would check each character. If the string is "abc", then the total counts are a:1, b:1, c:1. For d=1, k=3. So each part must have counts a:1/3, which is not possible. So d=1 is invalid. Then check d=3. k=1. So the entire string is the only part. The expected counts are a:1, b:1, c:1. The first part is the entire string, which matches. So return 3.

So the code would work.

But for the code to be efficient, perhaps we can precompute the expected counts and check the first part, and then check the sum of the rest of the parts' counts. Wait, but that's not possible. Because each part's counts must be exactly the expected counts. So, for example, if the first part is correct, but the second part is not, then the code must detect that.

But how else can we check this without processing each part?

Alternative approach: since the total counts are k * expected, and the first part is expected, then the sum of the remaining parts must be (k-1)*expected. But that's not sufficient. Because each part must be exactly expected. So, perhaps the code can check the first part, and then check the sum of the remaining parts' counts. But that's not sufficient. For example, if the first part is expected, and the sum of the remaining parts is (k-1)*expected, but one of the parts has more than expected and another has less, the sum would still be correct. But the individual parts would not be correct.

So, the code must check each part's counts.

But for large k, this is O(n) time. So, perhaps the code can be optimized by using a sliding window approach. For example, for a given d, the code can check the first part, then for the remaining parts, check if their counts are the same as the first part. But how?

Alternatively, since the code is checking for the first part, and then the rest, perhaps the code can precompute the cumulative counts and then check the differences. For example, the cumulative count up to the end of the first part is expected. Then, the cumulative count up to the end of the second part should be 2*expected, and so on. But this would require that the code can compute the cumulative counts efficiently.

But for that, perhaps we can precompute a prefix sum array for each character. Then, for each part, the code can check the difference between the prefix sums.

For example, for each character c, the prefix sum array is an array where prefix[i] is the number of c's in s[0..i-1]. Then, for a part from start to end (start = i*d, end = (i+1)*d), the count of c in that part is prefix[end] - prefix[start]. 

So, for each part, the code can compute the count of each character and compare to expected. 

This approach would be O(1) per part per character, but for each part, we have to check all 26 characters. So for a part of length d, the code would take O(26) time. For k parts, that's O(26*k) time. Which is better than O(d) per part, especially for large d.

So, this is a better approach. Let's see.

So, the steps would be:

1. Precompute the prefix sums for each character.

2. For each d in the sorted divisors:

   a. Check if the total counts are divisible by k = len(s)//d.

   b. Compute expected counts.

   c. Check sum(expected) == d.

   d. Check the first part's counts using the prefix sums.

   e. Then, for each of the remaining parts, check their counts using the prefix sums.

This would be O(26 * k) time per d, which is better than O(26 * d * k) time (if we process each part as a substring and count the characters).

So, this is a better approach.

So, how to implement this.

First, precompute the prefix sums for each character.

For example, for s = "abba", the prefix sums for 'a' would be [0,1,1,2,2], and for 'b' [0,0,1,1,2].

Then, for a part from 0 to 2 (d=2), the count of 'a' is prefix[2] - prefix[0] = 1-0=1. 'b' is 1-0=1. Which matches expected.

For the next part (2 to 4), the count of 'a' is 2-1=1, 'b' is 2-1=1. So matches.

So, this approach works.

So, the code can precompute the prefix sums for each character.

In Python, for each character in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', we can create a list of prefix counts.

But for efficiency, perhaps we can create a list of 26 lists, each of length n+1, where each list represents the prefix sum for a particular character.

But for a string of length 1e5, this would require 26 * 1e5 = 2.6e6 elements, which is manageable.

So, code steps:

n = len(s)

prefix = [ [0]*(n+1) for _ in range(26) ]

for i in range(n):

    c = s[i]

    idx = ord(c) - ord('a')

    for j in range(26):

        prefix[j][i+1] = prefix[j][i]

    prefix[idx][i+1] += 1

But this is O(n*26) time, which for n=1e5 is 2.6e6 operations. Which is acceptable.

Alternatively, for each character, we can compute the prefix sum in O(n) time. For example:

prefix = [ [0]*(n+1) for _ in range(26) ]

for i in range(n):

    c = s[i]

    idx = ord(c) - ord('a')

    for j in range(26):

        prefix[j][i+1] = prefix[j][i]

    prefix[idx][i+1] += 1

But this is O(n*26) time. Which is acceptable.

Once the prefix arrays are built, for a given d and k, the code can check each part as follows:

expected = [ ... ] # the expected counts for each character.

for part in 0 to k-1:

    start = part * d

    end = start + d

    for c in 0..25:

        count = prefix[c][end] - prefix[c][start]

        if count != expected[c]:

            return False

So, for each part, check all 26 characters. For k parts, this is O(26*k) time.

But for k up to 1e5 (when d=1), this is O(2.6e6) operations, which is acceptable.

So, this approach is feasible.

So, putting it all together:

The code would:

1. Compute the total_counts (sum of each character in s).

2. Precompute the prefix sums for each character.

3. Generate all divisors of len(s) in sorted order.

4. For each d in sorted divisors:

   a. k = len(s) // d.

   b. Check if all total_counts[c] is divisible by k. If not, skip.

   c. Compute expected counts for each character: total_counts[c] // k.

   d. Check if sum(expected) == d. If not, skip.

   e. Check the first part (0 to d) using the prefix sums. If any character's count in the first part doesn't match expected, skip.

   f. Check the remaining parts (from 1 to k-1). For each part, check all 26 characters' counts using the prefix sums. If any part doesn't match expected, skip.

   g. If all parts are valid, return d.

5. If no divisors are valid, return len(s) (but according to the problem statement, s is a concatenation of anagrams of t, so there must be at least one valid d, which is len(s) itself. Because t can be s, and the concatenation is just one part.)

So, the code can return the first valid d in the sorted list of divisors.

Now, let's code this.

But first, how to compute the total counts. We can use a Counter.

But for the code, perhaps it's easier to compute the total counts as a list of 26 integers.

So:

from collections import Counter

But for efficiency, perhaps:

total_counts = [0] * 26

for c in s:

    idx = ord(c) - ord('a')

    total_counts[idx] += 1

Then, for each d in the divisors:

k = len(s) // d

valid = True

for c in range(26):

    if total_counts[c] % k != 0:

        valid = False

        break

if not valid:

    continue

expected = [ total_counts[c] // k for c in range(26) ]

sum_expected = sum(expected)

if sum_expected != d:

    continue

Then, check the first part:

start = 0

end = d

valid_part = True

for c in range(26):

    if (prefix[c][end] - prefix[c][start]) != expected[c]:

        valid_part = False

        break

if not valid_part:

    continue

Then, check the remaining parts:

for i in range(1, k):

    start = i * d

    end = start + d

    for c in range(26):

        if (prefix[c][end] - prefix[c][start]) != expected[c]:

            valid_part = False

            break

    if not valid_part:

        break

if valid_part:

    return d

So, this is the code.

Now, let's test this with the examples.

Example 1: s = "abba", len(s) =4.

divisors are 1,2,4.

Check d=1:

k=4.

total_counts for a is 2, b is 2.

Check if 2%4 ==0? No. So skip.

d=2:

k=2.

Check 2%2=0 for a and b. Yes.

expected = [1,1]. sum is 2 ==d=2.

Check first part (0-2):

prefix for a is 1, b is 1. So matches.

Check remaining parts (i=1):

start=2, end=4.

prefix a: 2-1=1, b: 2-1=1. So matches. So return 2.

Example 2: s = "cdef", len=4.

divisors are 1,2,4.

Check d=1:

k=4.

total_counts for c:1, d:1, e:1, f:1. Each count is 1. 1%4 is 1, which is not 0. So skip.

d=2:

k=2. Each count is 1. 1%2 is 1. So skip.

d=4:
