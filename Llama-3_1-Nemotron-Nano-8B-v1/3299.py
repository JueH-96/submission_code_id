Okay, let's see. I need to find the maximum subset of the given array that can form a specific pattern. The pattern is like x, x², x⁴, ..., x^k/2, x^k, x^k/2, ..., x^4, x², x. Hmm, wait, the example given is [2,4,16,4,2]. Let me parse that. So the pattern starts with x, then x squared, then x^4 (since 2^4 is 16), then x^4 again (since 16 is x^4, then the next is x^2 (4), then x again (2). Wait, maybe the pattern is symmetric. Like, the first part is increasing exponents as powers of two, up to some maximum, then it mirrors back down. So for example, the first example's pattern is 2, 4 (2^2), 16 (2^4), then 4 (2^2), then 2. So the exponents are 1, 2, 4, 2, 1. So the structure is a palindrome in terms of exponents. So the exponents form a sequence that starts at 1, doubles each step until k (which is a power of two), then halves each step back to 1. Wait, but the problem statement says k can be any non-negative power of two. Wait, the example given in the problem has k=4. Because the exponents go up to 4 (like 2^4 is 16). So the pattern is built by first going up to x^k, then down. So the total elements in the subset would be (k's position steps) * 2 -1. Wait, for example, if k is 2 (so exponents 1, 2, 1), that's 3 elements. If k is 4, then exponents 1,2,4,2,1: 5 elements. So the length depends on the maximum exponent's power of two. 

So the problem is to select a subset of numbers that can form such a pattern. Each element in the subset must be a power of x, where the exponents follow the pattern described. The key is to find the maximum possible size of such a subset.

First, I need to model the possible patterns. For each possible x, and for each possible k (which is a power of two), check how many numbers in the array can form the sequence x, x², x^4, ..., x^k, x^k/2, ..., x², x. Then, among all possible x and k, find the maximum count.

But how do I approach this efficiently, given that the array can be up to 1e5 elements?

Let me think. For each number in the array, perhaps we can consider it as the center (the x^k element) and see how many elements can form the required pattern around it. Alternatively, for each possible x, we can compute the maximum possible sequence length.

But considering all possible x's in the array might be feasible. Let's see. For each x in the array, we can check all possible k's (powers of two) and see how many elements in the array can form the required exponents. Then, take the maximum over all x and k.

But how to model the exponents? Let's think. For a given x and k (which is a power of two), the exponents in the sequence are 1, 2, 4, ..., k, k/2, ..., 2, 1. Wait, no. Wait, the pattern is x, x², x^4, ..., x^k, then x^{k/2}, x^{k/4}, ..., x², x. Wait, no. Let's look at the example given. The first example's pattern is [2,4,16,4,2]. So the exponents are 1, 2, 4, 2, 1. So the maximum exponent is 4 (k=4). Then the sequence after the peak is 2, 1. So the exponents after the peak are k/2, k/4, etc., until 1. So for a given k (which is a power of two), the exponents are 1, 2, 4, ..., k, k/2, k/4, ..., 2, 1. Wait, but k must be a power of two. So for example, if k is 8, then the exponents would be 1,2,4,8,4,2,1. So the total elements are 2*(log2(k)) +1. Wait, for k=1, the exponents are just 1. For k=2, exponents are 1,2,1. For k=4, 1,2,4,2,1. So the number of elements is 2*(log2(k)) +1. Wait, log2(k) gives the exponent. For example, k=4 is 2^2, so log2(k) is 2. So 2*2 +1=5 elements, which matches the example. So the number of elements in the pattern is 2*m +1, where m is the exponent (since k=2^m). So m is the number of times you can double starting from 1 until you reach k. For example, m=2 for k=4 (since 1, 2, 4). So the pattern length is 2*m +1. Wait, no. For m=2, the exponents are 1,2,4,2,1. That's 5 elements, which is 2*2 +1=5. So yes. So for a given k=2^m, the pattern has 2m+1 elements. So the maximum possible m is such that 2^m is the maximum possible exponent.

But how do we model this for each x in the array?

For each x, we can look for all possible exponents e (which are powers of two) and see how many elements in the array can form the sequence for that x and e.

But how to compute that efficiently.

Alternative approach: For each element in the array, consider it as the center (the x^k element). Then, check how many elements can form the required exponents. The maximum of all these would be the answer.

But how to model the exponents. Let's take an example. Suppose the center is x^k. Then, the elements in the subset must include x, x², x^4, ..., x^k, then x^{k/2}, x^{k/4}, ..., x², x. So for each x, and for each possible k (power of two), we need to check if the array has elements for all these exponents.

But how to represent the exponents. For example, for x=2 and k=4 (so exponents 1,2,4,2,1), the required elements are 2,4,16,4,2. So the subset must have at least one 2, one 4, one 16, etc. But in the first example, the input is [5,4,1,2,2]. The subset chosen is 4,2,2. Wait, but according to the example explanation, the subset is {4,2,2}, which is arranged as [2,4,2]. Wait, that's a different pattern. Wait, the example says the pattern is [2,4,2], which would correspond to exponents 1,2,1. So the center is 4 (x²), and the pattern is x, x², x. So the k here is 2. So the exponents are 1,2,1. So the subset has three elements. So in this case, the center is 4 (x²), and the elements are x=2, x²=4, x=2. So the subset includes two 2's and one 4.

So the approach is: for each possible x (the base), and for each possible m (the exponent of the center, which is a power of two), check how many elements in the array can form the required exponents. Then, take the maximum count.

But how to model this. Let's think of the exponents as a sequence. For a given x and m (where the center is x^{2^m}), the exponents are 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^m, 2^{m-1}, ..., 2, 1. So the total exponents are 2m+1. For example, m=0: exponents [1], count 1. m=1: [1,2,1], count 3. m=2: [1,2,4,2,1], count 5. And so on.

So for each x in the array, and for each possible m (starting from 0), we can check how many elements in the array have values x^{2^0}, x^{2^1}, ..., x^{2^m}, x^{2^{m-1}}, ..., x^{2^0}. The count is the sum of the frequencies of each of these exponents. But wait, the exponents are in the order of increasing up to 2^m, then decreasing. But the elements can be arranged in any order as long as they form the pattern. So the actual order doesn't matter for the count. The count is the sum of the frequencies of each required exponent. For example, in the first example, x=2, m=1. The exponents are 1,2,1. The array has two 2's (x^1) and one 4 (x^2). So the count is 2+1=3. But wait, the subset is {4,2,2}, which is three elements. So the sum of the frequencies for exponents 1 and 2 is 2 (for 1) and 1 (for 2), but the pattern requires one 2 (x^1) in the first position, one 4 (x^2) in the second, and another 2 (x^1) in the third. So the frequencies must have at least one occurrence for each exponent. But in the example, the subset uses two 2's. So the frequencies for x=2 must have at least two 2's (since exponent 1 is required twice). Wait, no. Wait, the exponents in the pattern are 1,2,1. So each occurrence of exponent 1 is needed once. But in the array, there are two 2's. So the count is 2 (for exponent 1) +1 (exponent 2) =3. So the sum of the frequencies of each required exponent gives the maximum possible elements for that x and m.

But wait, the pattern requires that each exponent in the sequence is present. For example, for m=1, the exponents are 1,2,1. So the required exponents are 1,2. But each occurrence of 1 is needed twice. So the array must have at least two 1's (exponent 1) and one 2 (exponent 2). So the sum is 2+1=3. So the approach is: for each x and m, collect all the exponents required (each exponent in the sequence), count their frequencies, and sum the minimum between the required count and the available frequency. Wait, no. Because each exponent in the sequence must be present once. For example, in the sequence [1,2,1], the exponents 1 and 2 are each required twice and once, respectively. Wait, no. The exponents in the sequence are 1, 2, 1. So exponent 1 appears twice, exponent 2 appears once. So for x=2 and m=1, the required exponents are 1 (twice) and 2 (once). So the array must have at least two elements of 2^1=2 and one element of 2^2=4. So the sum is 2+1=3. So the way to model this is: for each x and m, generate all the exponents in the sequence (for example, for m=1, the exponents are [1,2,1]), then for each exponent in that list, count how many times it appears. Then, the sum of the counts (but each occurrence in the sequence requires a unique element from the array). So for the example, the sequence has two 1's and one 2. So the array must have at least two 2's (since 2^1=2) and one 4. So the maximum possible elements is 3.

So the approach is: for each x in the array, and for each possible m (starting from 0), generate the sequence of exponents (like 1,2,4,...,2^m, 2^{m-1},...,1), then for each exponent e in this sequence, check if x^e exists in the array. The count is the sum of the frequencies of x^e for each e in the sequence. But wait, no. Because each e in the sequence must be present once. So for the sequence [1,2,1], the exponents are 1,2,1. So the required exponents are 1,2,1. So the array must have at least two elements of x^1 and one of x^2. So the count is the sum of the frequencies of x^e for each e in the sequence, but each occurrence in the sequence requires a separate element. So for the example, the count is 2 (for the two 1's) +1 (for the 2) =3.

But how to compute this efficiently. For each x and m, generate the list of exponents (like for m=1, exponents are [1,2,1]), then for each e in that list, check if x^e is present in the array, and sum the counts. But the problem is that for large m, the list can be very long, and for each x, this could be time-consuming.

But given that the array can be up to 1e5 elements, and x can be up to 1e9, we need an efficient way.

Alternative approach: For each x in the array, precompute all possible exponents (as powers of two) and track their counts. Then, for each possible m, generate the required exponents and sum the counts. The maximum sum across all x and m is the answer.

But how to precompute the exponents for each x. Let's think. For each x in the array, we can compute x^1, x^2, x^4, x^8, etc., and check if these values exist in the array. For each x, we can generate all possible exponents (powers of two) up to a certain limit. But since x can be up to 1e9, x^2 can be up to 1e18, which is larger than the maximum possible element in the array (since the array elements are up to 1e9). So for x >=2, x^4 is 16, which may not be present in the array. So for each x, the possible exponents are limited. For example, x=2, exponents 1,2,4,8, etc. But if the array doesn't have x^4, then m can't be 2 for that x.

So the steps could be:

1. Create a frequency map (count_dict) of the array elements. So count_dict[num] is the number of times num appears in the array.

2. For each x in the array (but considering unique x's to avoid redundant processing), generate all possible exponents (powers of two) and check if x^e exists in the array. For each x, we can precompute a list of exponents and their counts. For example, for x=2, if the array has 2,4,16, then exponents 1,2,4 are present. So for x=2, the possible m's are up to 2 (since 2^2=4 is present). 

3. For each x, and for each possible m (based on the exponents present), generate the sequence of exponents (like 1,2,4,2,1 for m=2), then for each exponent in the sequence, check if x^e is present in the array, and sum the counts. The maximum sum across all x and m is the answer.

But how to generate the sequence of exponents for a given m. For example, m is the exponent of the highest power. So for m=2, the highest exponent is 4 (2^2). The sequence is 1,2,4,2,1. So the exponents are generated by first going up to 2^m, then down to 1. So the sequence is 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^m, 2^{m-1}, ..., 2^0. Wait, no. For m=2, the exponents are 1 (2^0), 2 (2^1), 4 (2^2), 2 (2^1), 1 (2^0). So the sequence is 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^1, 2^0. So the exponents are generated as follows: start at 1 (2^0), then double each time until reaching 2^m, then halve each time until back to 1. So the exponents are 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^m, 2^{m-1}, ..., 2^0. Wait, but 2^m is the highest exponent. So for m=2, the highest exponent is 4 (2^2). Then the sequence is 1,2,4,2,1. So the exponents are 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^1, 2^0. So the number of elements in the sequence is 2m+1. For m=2, 5 elements.

So for a given x and m, the sequence of exponents is:

exponents = []
current = 1
exponents.append(current)
for i in range(1, m+1):
    current *= 2
    exponents.append(current)
current = exponents[-1] // 2
while current > 1:
    exponents.append(current)
    current = current // 2
exponents.append(1)

Wait, but for m=2, the exponents would be 1,2,4,2,1. So the code would generate:

start with 1.

Then for i from 1 to m (2):

i=1: current=2, add to exponents.

i=2: current=4, add to exponents.

Then, current is 4. Then, current//2 is 2. Add to exponents. Then current becomes 1. So the loop stops. So exponents are [1,2,4,2,1]. Which is correct.

So the code for generating the exponents for a given m is:

exponents = [1]
current = 1
for _ in range(m):
    current *= 2
    exponents.append(current)
# Now, current is 2^m
# Now, add the descending part
current = current // 2
while current > 1:
    exponents.append(current)
    current = current // 2
exponents.append(1)

Wait, but for m=0, the exponents would be [1]. For m=1, the exponents would be [1,2,1]. For m=2, [1,2,4,2,1]. So that's correct.

So for each x and m, generate the exponents list, then for each exponent e in the list, check if x^e is present in the array. Then, sum the count of x^e for each e in the exponents list. The maximum sum across all x and m is the answer.

But how to compute this efficiently.

First, create a frequency map (count_dict) of the array elements.

Then, for each unique x in the array:

   precompute all possible exponents e (powers of two) such that x^e is present in the array. For example, for x=2, check if 2,4,8,16, etc., are present. For each e, track the maximum possible m.

But how to find all possible m for x. For example, for x=2, if the array has 2,4,16, then the possible exponents are 1,2,4. So the maximum m is 2 (since 4=2^2). So for x=2, possible m's are 0,1,2.

But how to find all possible m's for x. For each x, we can generate exponents e (as powers of two) and check if x^e is present in the array. For each e, we can track the maximum possible m. For example, for x=2, the exponents present are 1,2,4. So the maximum m is 2 (since 4=2^2). So for x=2, possible m's are 0,1,2.

But how to generate all possible m's for x. For each x, the possible m's are the exponents e (as powers of two) such that x^e is present in the array, and e is a power of two. Wait, no. For example, for x=2, the exponents are 1,2,4. So the maximum m is 2 (since 4=2^2). So m can be up to 2. So for x=2, possible m's are 0,1,2.

But how to find all possible m's for x. For each x, the possible m's are the exponents e (as powers of two) such that x^e is present in the array, and e is a power of two. Wait, but e is the exponent in the sequence. For example, for x=2, the exponents in the sequence are 1,2,4, etc. So for each x, the possible m's are the maximum possible exponents that can be formed by doubling starting from 1, such that x^e is present in the array.

So for x=2, if the array has 2,4,16, then the exponents are 1,2,4. So the maximum m is 2 (since 4=2^2). So for x=2, possible m's are 0,1,2.

So the approach is:

For each x in the array:

   collect all exponents e (as powers of two) such that x^e is present in the array. For example, for x=2, e can be 1,2,4.

   Then, the possible m's are the exponents e (as powers of two) divided by 2. Wait, no. For example, for e=4, m is 2 (since 4=2^2). So m is log2(e). So for each e in the exponents list, m is log2(e). So the possible m's are the log2 of the exponents. But the exponents must be powers of two. So for x=2, the exponents are 1 (2^0), 2 (2^1), 4 (2^2), etc. So the possible m's are 0,1,2, etc.

But how to find the maximum possible m for x. For x, the maximum m is the largest integer such that x^{2^m} is present in the array. For example, x=2, if 2^4=16 is present, then m can be 2 (since 2^2=4, 2^4=16). So the maximum m is 2.

So for each x, the possible m's are 0,1,..., up to the maximum m where x^{2^m} is present in the array.

So the steps for each x are:

1. Find all exponents e (as powers of two) such that x^e is present in the array. For example, for x=2, e can be 1,2,4,8, etc., but only if x^e is in the array.

2. For each e in this list, compute m = log2(e). For example, e=4, m=2.

3. The possible m's for x are the m's computed from the exponents. The maximum m is the maximum of these m's.

But how to generate all possible m's for x. For example, if x has exponents 1,2,4, then the possible m's are 0,1,2. So for each x, the possible m's are 0 up to the maximum m (log2(max_e)).

But how to generate the list of possible m's. For example, for x=2, the exponents are 1,2,4. So the possible m's are 0,1,2. So for each x, the possible m's are 0,1,..., up to the maximum m.

But how to find the maximum m for x. The maximum m is the largest m where x^{2^m} is present in the array.

So for x, the maximum m is the maximum exponent e (as a power of two) in the exponents list, then m is log2(e). For example, e=4, m=2.

So for each x, the possible m's are 0,1,..., up to the maximum m.

But how to generate all possible m's for x. For example, if x has exponents 1,2,4,8, then the possible m's are 0,1,2,3.

So for each x, the possible m's are 0 up to the maximum m (log2 of the maximum exponent e).

So for each x, the possible m's are 0,1,..., max_m.

But how to compute this. For each x, we can collect all exponents e (as powers of two) present in the array, then compute their log2(e) to get m's. The maximum m is the maximum of these m's. Then, the possible m's are 0 to max_m.

But for each x, the possible m's are all integers from 0 up to the maximum m. For example, if the maximum m is 3, then m can be 0,1,2,3.

But for each m in 0 to max_m, we need to check if all the exponents in the sequence for that m are present in the array.

Wait, no. Because for a given x and m, the sequence of exponents is generated as per the pattern. For example, for m=2, the exponents are 1,2,4,2,1. So for x=2, the required exponents are 1,2,4. So if the array has 2,4,16 (x^4=16), then for m=2, the exponents are 1,2,4,2,1. So the required exponents are 1,2,4. So the array must have at least one occurrence of each of these exponents. But the count for each exponent is the number of times it appears in the array. For example, if the array has two 2's (x^1), one 4 (x^2), and one 16 (x^4), then for m=2, the sum would be 2 (for the two 2's) +1 (4) +1 (16) +1 (4 again) +2 (2 again). Wait, no. Wait, the sequence for m=2 is [1,2,4,2,1]. So the exponents are 1,2,4,2,1. So each occurrence of 1 in the sequence requires a separate element. So for the array to form this sequence, the array must have at least two 2's (x^1) and one 4 (x^2), and one 16 (x^4). So the sum is 2 (for the two 1's) +1 (2) +1 (4) +1 (2) +1 (1) = 6? Wait, no. Wait, the exponents in the sequence are 1,2,4,2,1. So the required elements are x^1, x^2, x^4, x^2, x^1. So the array must have at least two x^1 elements and two x^2 elements, and one x^4 element. So the sum is 2 (x^1) + 2 (x^2) +1 (x^4) =5. But in the array, if there are two x^1, one x^2, and one x^4, then the sum would be min(2,2) (for x^1) + min(1,2) (for x^2) + min(1,1) (for x^4) = 2+1+1=4. But the array may not have enough elements. So the sum is the sum of the minimum between the required count and the available count for each exponent in the sequence.

Wait, this complicates things. Because for each exponent in the sequence, the required count is the number of times it appears in the sequence. For example, in the sequence [1,2,4,2,1], the exponents 1 appears twice, 2 appears twice, 4 appears once. So for each exponent e in the sequence, the required count is the number of times e appears in the sequence. The available count is the frequency of x^e in the array. The sum is the sum of min(required_count[e], available_count[e]) for all e in the sequence.

But this is not correct. Because the sequence requires that each occurrence in the sequence is covered by a separate element. So for example, if the sequence has two 1's, the array must have at least two elements of x^1. So the sum is the sum of the available counts for each exponent in the sequence, but each occurrence in the sequence requires a separate element. So the sum is the sum of the available counts for each exponent in the sequence, but each exponent's available count is the number of times it appears in the sequence. Wait, no. For example, if the sequence has two 1's, and the array has three 2's (x^1), then the sum for that exponent is 2. So the sum is the sum of the minimum between the required count (number of times e appears in the sequence) and the available count (frequency of x^e in the array).

So for each x and m, the steps are:

1. Generate the sequence of exponents for m. For example, m=2 gives [1,2,4,2,1].

2. For each exponent e in the sequence, count how many times it appears in the sequence. For example, in the sequence [1,2,4,2,1], e=1 appears 2 times, e=2 appears 2 times, e=4 appears 1 time.

3. For each e in the sequence, check if x^e is present in the array. If not, then the sum is 0. Otherwise, the available count is the frequency of x^e in the array.

4. The sum for this x and m is the sum of min(required_count[e], available_count[e]) for all e in the sequence.

But this approach is computationally expensive. For each x and m, we need to generate the sequence, count the required counts for each e, then sum the min(required, available). For large m, this could be O(m) per x and m, which is not feasible for large arrays.

So we need a way to compute this sum efficiently.

Alternative idea: For each x, precompute all possible exponents e (as powers of two) and their frequencies. Then, for each possible m, generate the sequence of exponents and compute the sum of the required counts.

But how to compute the required counts for each e in the sequence.

Wait, the required counts for each e in the sequence can be determined by the structure of the sequence. For example, for m=2, the sequence is [1,2,4,2,1]. The required counts are:

1: 2 times

2: 2 times

4: 1 time

So for a general m, the required counts can be determined by the structure of the sequence. The sequence is symmetric. The first part is 1,2,4,...,2^m. The second part is 2^{m-1}, ..., 2^0. So the required counts for each exponent e can be determined by how many times e appears in the sequence.

But how to compute this for any m.

Let's think of the sequence as follows:

The sequence starts at 1 and doubles each step until reaching 2^m. Then, it halves each step until back to 1. So the sequence is:

1, 2, 4, ..., 2^m, 2^{m-1}, ..., 2^1, 2^0.

Wait, no. For m=2, the sequence is 1,2,4,2,1. So the exponents are 1,2,4,2,1. So the first part is 1,2,4 (up to 2^m=4), then 2,1 (down to 1). So the exponents are 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^1, 2^0. So for general m, the exponents are:

For i from 0 to m: 2^i

Then, for i from m-1 down to 0: 2^i

So the total number of elements is 2m+1.

So for each exponent e in the sequence, the required count is the number of times e appears in the sequence.

For example, e=2^k, where 0 <=k <=m.

In the sequence, e=2^k appears once in the first part (when i=k) and once in the second part (when i=k, but m-1 >=k). Wait, no. For example, for m=2, e=2^1=2 appears in the first part (i=1) and in the second part (i=1, since m-1=1). So for e=2, the required count is 2.

For e=2^0=1, it appears once in the first part (i=0) and once in the second part (i=0). So required count is 2.

For e=2^m, it appears once in the first part (i=m) and not in the second part. So required count is 1.

For e=2^k where 0 <k <m, the required count is 2.

So the required count for e=2^k is:

if k ==0: 2 (if m >=0)

if k ==m: 1

else: 2

Wait, for m=0, the sequence is [1]. So required count for e=1 is 1.

For m=1, the sequence is [1,2,1]. So e=1: 2 times, e=2: 1 time.

For m=2, e=1: 2 times, e=2: 2 times, e=4: 1 time.

For m=3, the sequence is [1,2,4,8,4,2,1]. So e=1: 2 times, e=2: 2 times, e=4: 2 times, e=8: 1 time.

So the required count for e=2^k is:

if k ==0: 2 (if m >=0)

if k ==m: 1

else: 2 (if k>0 and k <m)

But wait, for m=0, k=0, required count is 1.

So the general formula is:

required_count[e] = 2 if e is not the maximum exponent (2^m) and e is not 1 (when m=0).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's find a general way to compute the required count for each e in the sequence.

The sequence is:

For i from 0 to m: 2^i

For i from m-1 down to 0: 2^i

So the exponents are:

2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^m, 2^{m-1}, ..., 2^0.

So each exponent 2^k (for 0 <=k <=m) appears exactly twice, except for 2^m, which appears once, and 2^0, which appears twice only if m>0. Wait, no. For m=0, the sequence is [2^0], so required count is 1. For m=1, the sequence is [2^0, 2^1, 2^0], so 2^0 appears twice, 2^1 once. For m=2, 2^0 appears twice, 2^1 appears twice, 2^2 once. For m=3, 2^0 appears twice, 2^1 twice, 2^2 twice, 2^3 once.

So the required count for e=2^k is:

if k ==0: 2 (if m >=1) or 1 (if m=0)

if k ==m: 1

else: 2

So for a general m and k:

required_count[e] = 2 if e is not the maximum exponent (2^m) and e is not 1 (when m=0).

But how to model this.

Alternatively, for each e in the sequence, the required count is:

if e is 2^m: 1

else: 2

But for m=0, e=2^0=1, required count is 1.

So the general rule is:

required_count[e] = 1 if e is the maximum exponent (2^m) or if m=0 and e=1.

Otherwise, required_count[e] = 2.

But how to compute this for a given e and m.

Alternatively, for a given m, the required counts can be determined as follows:

The maximum exponent is 2^m.

For each e in the sequence:

if e == 2^m: required count is 1.

else: required count is 2.

But for m=0, the sequence is [1], so e=1 is the maximum exponent (2^0), required count is 1.

For m=1, the sequence is [1,2,1]. The maximum exponent is 2^1=2. So e=2 has required count 1, others 2.

So this seems to hold.

So the required count for each e in the sequence is 2, except for the maximum exponent (2^m), which has required count 1.

So for a given x and m, the sum is:

sum = (number of elements in the sequence) -1 (since the maximum exponent is counted once) + 1 (for the maximum exponent's required count of 1). Wait, no. Let's think.

The total number of elements in the sequence is 2m+1. For each e in the sequence, the required count is 2, except for the maximum exponent (2^m), which is 1. So the sum is:

sum = (2m+1 -1) * 2 + 1*1 ?

No. Wait, the sum is the sum of required counts for each e in the sequence. For example, for m=2, the sequence has 5 elements. The required counts are 2 for 1, 2 for 2, 1 for 4. So sum is 2+2+1=5. Which is 5 elements. So the sum is (number of elements) -1 (since the maximum exponent is counted once) plus 1. No, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the sum is (number of elements) -1) * 2 + 1. Because all elements except the maximum are counted twice, and the maximum is counted once. For example, m=2: 5 elements. 4 elements are counted as 2 each (sum 8), plus 1 for the maximum. Total 9. But that's not correct. Wait, no. For m=2, the sum is 2 (for 1) + 2 (for 2) +1 (for 4) =5. Which is the same as the number of elements. So this approach is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps the required count for each e is 2, except for the maximum exponent, which is 1. So the sum is (number of elements) -1) * 2 +1. For m=2, number of elements is 5. (5-1)*2 +1= 8+1=9. Which is not correct. So this approach is wrong.

So perhaps the required count for each e is 2, except for the maximum exponent, which is 1. So the sum is (number of elements) -1) * 2 +1. But this doesn't match the example. So this approach is incorrect.

So perhaps the required count for each e is 2, except for the maximum exponent, which is 1. But how to compute the sum.

Alternatively, the sum is the sum of 2 for each e in the sequence, except for the maximum exponent, which is 1. So sum = (number of elements) * 2 -1. For m=2, number of elements is 5. 5*2-1=9. Which is not correct. So this approach is wrong.

So perhaps the required count for each e is 2, except for the maximum exponent, which is 1. But how to compute the sum.

Wait, for m=0, the sequence is [1]. Sum is 1.

For m=1, sequence is [1,2,1]. Sum is 2+1+2=5? No, the required counts are 2 for 1, 1 for 2. So sum is 2+1+2=5? No, the required counts are 2 for 1 (appears twice), 1 for 2. So sum is 2+1=3. Which is the number of elements (3). So this approach is not working.

So perhaps the required count for each e is the number of times it appears in the sequence. So for each e in the sequence, required_count[e] is the number of occurrences of e in the sequence.

So for m=2, the sequence is [1,2,4,2,1]. The required counts are:

1: 2

2: 2

4: 1

Sum is 2+2+1=5.

Which is the number of elements in the sequence.

So the sum is equal to the number of elements in the sequence. But that's not possible. Because the sum is the sum of the required counts for each e, which is the number of times e appears in the sequence. So the sum is exactly the number of elements in the sequence.

But that's not helpful. Because the sum is the number of elements in the sequence, but the actual available elements may be less than that.

So for each x and m, the sum is the number of elements in the sequence (2m+1) if all required exponents are present in the array. But if some exponents are missing, the sum is the sum of the available counts for each e in the sequence.

But how to compute this sum efficiently.

Alternative approach: For each x and m, the sum is the sum of the frequencies of x^e for each e in the sequence. But each e in the sequence must be present in the array. If any e in the sequence is not present, the sum is zero.

Wait, no. For example, if the sequence requires e=4, but the array doesn't have x^4, then the sum is zero. But if some e's are present and others are not, the sum is the sum of the frequencies of the present e's. But the sequence requires all e's to be present. So if any e in the sequence is not present in the array, then the sum is zero. Because the sequence can't be formed.

Wait, no. For example, if the sequence requires e=4, but the array has x^2 but not x^4, then the sequence can't be formed. So the sum is zero. So for a given x and m, the sum is the sum of the frequencies of x^e for each e in the sequence, but only if all e's in the sequence are present in the array. Otherwise, the sum is zero.

But this is not correct. For example, if the sequence requires e=4 and e=2, but the array has x^2 but not x^4, then the sum is zero. But if the array has x^2 and x^4, but not x^1, then the sum is zero. So the sum is the sum of the frequencies of x^e for each e in the sequence, but only if all e's in the sequence are present. Otherwise, the sum is zero.

But this is not correct. Because the sequence requires all e's to be present. So if any e in the sequence is missing, the sum is zero. Otherwise, the sum is the sum of the frequencies of x^e for each e in the sequence.

But this is not correct. For example, if the sequence requires e=1,2,4, but the array has x^1 and x^2, but not x^4, then the sum is zero. But if the array has x^1, x^2, and x^4, but x^1 has a frequency of 3, then the sum is 3 (for x^1) + 2 (x^2) +1 (x^4) =6. But the sequence requires two x^1's, two x^2's, and one x^4. So the sum is min(3,2) + min(2,2) + min(1,1) =2+2+1=5.

So the sum is the sum of the minimum between the required count and the available count for each e in the sequence.

But this requires knowing the required count for each e in the sequence.

So the steps are:

For each x and m:

1. Generate the sequence of exponents for m.

2. For each e in the sequence, compute the required count (number of times e appears in the sequence).

3. For each e in the sequence, check if x^e is present in the array. If any e is not present, the sum is zero.

4. Otherwise, sum the minimum between the required count and the available count (frequency of x^e) for each e in the sequence.

But this is computationally expensive for large m. For example, if m is 20, the sequence has 41 elements, and for each x and m, we need to process 41 exponents.

But given that the array can be up to 1e5 elements, and x can be up to 1e9, this approach may not be feasible.

So we need a way to compute this sum efficiently.

Alternative idea: For each x, precompute all possible exponents e (as powers of two) and their frequencies. Then, for each possible m, generate the required exponents and their required counts, and sum the minimum between required and available.

But how to generate the required exponents and their required counts for a given m.

For example, for m=2, the required exponents are 1,2,4,2,1. The required counts are 2,2,1.

So for x=2, if the array has frequencies:

2^1: 3

2^2: 1

2^4: 1

Then the sum is min(3,2) + min(1,2) + min(1,1) =2+1+1=4.

But how to compute this sum efficiently.

Another observation: For a given x and m, the required exponents are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^m, 2^{m-1}, ..., 2^0. So the exponents are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^m, and then 2^{m-1}, ..., 2^0.

So the required exponents are all the exponents from 2^0 to 2^m, and then back to 2^0. So the exponents are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^m, 2^{m-1}, ..., 2^0.

So the required exponents are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^m, and each of these exponents (except 2^m) appears twice. 2^m appears once.

So for a given x and m, the required exponents are:

- 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^{m-1}, 2^m, 2^{m-1}, ..., 2^0.

So the required exponents are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^m, and then 2^{m-1}, ..., 2^0.

So the required exponents are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^m, and each of these exponents (except 2^m) appears twice. 2^m appears once.

So for each x and m, the required exponents are:

- For i from 0 to m: 2^i

- For i from m-1 down to 0: 2^i

So the required exponents are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^m, 2^{m-1}, ..., 2^0.

So the required counts for each exponent e=2^k are:

- If k ==m: 1

- Else: 2

So for each x and m, the sum is:

sum = sum_{k=0 to m} (required_count[2^k] * available_count[x^{2^k}])

But required_count[2^k] is 2 for k <m, and 1 for k=m.

So sum = available_count[x^{2^0}] * 2 + available_count[x^{2^1}] * 2 + ... + available_count[x^{2^{m-1}}] * 2 + available_count[x^{2^m}] * 1.

But this is only true if all exponents 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^m are present in the array. Otherwise, the sum is zero.

So the steps are:

For each x in the array:

   precompute all possible exponents e=2^k (k >=0) such that x^e is present in the array.

   For each such e, compute k = log2(e).

   The possible m's for x are the maximum k among these exponents.

   For each possible m (from 0 up to the maximum k):

      check if all exponents 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^m are present in the array.

      If yes:

          sum = 2*(available_count[x^{2^0}] + available_count[x^{2^1}] + ... + available_count[x^{2^{m-1}}}) + available_count[x^{2^m}]

          keep track of the maximum sum.

      else:

          skip this m.

But how to check if all exponents 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^m are present in the array.

For example, for x=2 and m=2, we need to check if 2^0=1, 2^1=2, 2^2=4 are present in the array.

If any of these exponents is not present, then this m is not possible.

So for each x and m, we need to check if all exponents 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^m are present in the array.

But how to do this efficiently.

For each x, we can precompute a list of exponents e=2^k that are present in the array, sorted by k.

For example, for x=2, if the array has 2,4,16, then the exponents are 1,2,4 (k=0,1,2). So the list is [1,2,4], sorted by k.

Then, for each possible m (up to the maximum k), we can check if all exponents up to 2^m are present.

For example, for m=2, check if exponents 1,2,4 are present. If yes, then proceed.

So for each x, the possible m's are the maximum k in the exponents list, and all m's up to that.

But how to find the maximum m for x.

The maximum m is the maximum k in the exponents list.

So for x=2, the maximum m is 2.

So for each x, the possible m's are 0,1,2.

For each m in 0 to max_m:

   check if all exponents 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^m are present in the array.

   If yes:

      compute the sum as 2*(sum of available counts for exponents 2^0 to 2^{m-1}) + available_count[2^m]

      update the maximum sum.

So the steps are:

For each x in the array:

   collect all exponents e=2^k (k >=0) such that x^e is present in the array.

   sort these exponents by k in ascending order.

   if no exponents, skip.

   max_k = maximum k in the exponents.

   for m in 0 to max_k:

      required exponents are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^m.

      check if all these exponents are present in the exponents list.

      if yes:

          sum = 2*(sum of available counts for exponents 2^0 to 2^{m-1}) + available_count[2^m]

          update the maximum sum.

      else:

          break (since higher m's will also require exponents up to m, which are not present)

But how to check if all exponents up to m are present.

For example, for x=2, exponents list is [1,2,4] (k=0,1,2). For m=2, required exponents are 1,2,4. All are present. For m=3, required exponents are 1,2,4,8. But 8 is not present, so m=3 is not possible.

So for each x, the possible m's are up to the maximum k where all exponents up to 2^m are present.

So for x=2, the possible m's are 0,1,2.

For each m in 0 to max_k:

   check if for all i from 0 to m, 2^i is present in the exponents list.

   if yes:

      compute sum.

   else:

      break.

But how to check this efficiently.

For example, for x=2, exponents list is [1,2,4], sorted by k.

For m=0: check if 2^0=1 is present. Yes.

For m=1: check if 2^0 and 2^1 are present. Yes.

For m=2: check if 2^0, 2^1, 2^2 are present. Yes.

For m=3: check if 2^3=8 is present. No. So break.

So for each x, the possible m's are up to the maximum k where all exponents up to 2^m are present.

But how to find this.

An alternative approach is to precompute for each x the list of exponents sorted by k. Then, for each m from 0 to max_k, check if the exponents list contains all exponents up to 2^m.

But this can be done by checking if the exponents list contains 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^m.

But for large m, this can be time-consuming.

But given that the exponents are sorted by k, we can check for each m whether the exponents list contains 2^m.

Wait, no. For example, for m=2, we need to check if 2^0, 2^1, 2^2 are present.

But if the exponents list contains 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, then for m=2, all required exponents are present.

So for each x, the exponents list is sorted by k. So for m=0, check if 2^0 is present. For m=1, check if 2^1 is present. For m=2, check if 2^2 is present. And so on.

But this is not correct. Because for m=2, we need to check if 2^0, 2^1, 2^2 are present.

But if the exponents list contains 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, then for m=2, all required exponents are present.

So for each x, the possible m's are the maximum m where for all i from 0 to m, 2^i is present in the exponents list.

So the maximum m for x is the largest m where 2^m is present in the exponents list, and all exponents 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^m are present.

But how to find this.

For example, if the exponents list for x is [1,2,4,8], then the maximum m is 3, since 2^3=8 is present, and all exponents up to 8 are present.

But if the exponents list is [1,4,8], then for m=2, 2^2=4 is present, but 2^1=2 is not. So m=2 is not possible. The maximum m is 0, since 2^0=1 is present, but 2^1=2 is not.

So the maximum m for x is the largest m where for all i from 0 to m, 2^i is present in the exponents list.

So to find the maximum m for x, we can iterate through the exponents list (sorted by k) and find the largest m where all exponents up to 2^m are present.

But how to do this efficiently.

For example, for x's exponents list sorted by k: [1,2,4,8], the maximum m is 3.

For x's exponents list sorted by k: [1,4,8], the maximum m is 0.

So the approach is:

For x's exponents list sorted by k:

   m starts at 0.

   for each exponent in the list (sorted by k):

       if the exponent is 2^m, then m +=1.

       else, break.

   the maximum m is the final m.

Wait, no. For example, exponents list [1,2,4,8], sorted by k:

m starts at 0.

First exponent is 1=2^0: m becomes 1.

Next exponent is 2=2^1: m becomes 2.

Next exponent is 4=2^2: m becomes 3.

Next exponent is 8=2^3: m becomes 4.

So maximum m is 4.

But for exponents list [1,4,8], sorted by k:

m starts at 0.

First exponent is 1=2^0: m becomes 1.

Next exponent is 4=2^2: but 2^1=2 is not present. So the loop breaks. So maximum m is 0.

So this approach works.

So the algorithm for finding the maximum m for x is:

Sort the exponents list by k in ascending order.

Initialize m=0.

Iterate through each exponent in the sorted list:

   if exponent == 2^m:

       m +=1

   else:

       break.

The maximum m is m-1.

Wait, no. For example, exponents list [1,2,4,8], sorted by k:

m starts at 0.

First exponent is 1=2^0: m becomes 1.

Second exponent is 2=2^1: m becomes 2.

Third exponent is 4=2^2: m becomes 3.

Fourth exponent is 8=2^3: m becomes 4.

After processing all exponents, the maximum m is 3 (since 2^3=8 is present, and all exponents up to 2^3 are present).

But according to the algorithm, after processing all exponents, m is 4. So the maximum m is 3 (m-1).

So the algorithm should return m-1.

So the steps are:

Sort the exponents list by k in ascending order.

Initialize m=0.

For each exponent in the sorted list:

   if exponent == 2^m:

       m +=1

   else:

       break.

The maximum m is m-1.

So for exponents list [1,2,4,8], m becomes 4, so maximum m is 3.

For exponents list [1,4,8], m becomes 1 after first exponent, then the next exponent is 4=2^2, which is not equal to 2^1=2. So the loop breaks. So maximum m is 0.

So this algorithm correctly finds the maximum m for x.

Once we have the maximum m for x, we can iterate m from 0 to max_m and compute the sum for each m.

But how to compute the sum for each m.

For each m in 0 to max_m:

   required exponents are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^m.

   check if all these exponents are present in the exponents list.

   if yes:

       sum = 2*(sum of available counts for exponents 2^0 to 2^{m-1}) + available_count[2^m]

       update the maximum sum.

   else:

       break.

But how to check if all exponents up to m are present.

But according to the way we computed max_m, for m up to max_m, all exponents up to 2^m are present.

Because the max_m is computed as the largest m where all exponents up to 2^m are present.

So for each m from 0 to max_m, the exponents 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^m are present.

So for each m in 0 to max_m, the sum can be computed as:

sum = 2*(sum of available counts for exponents 2^0 to 2^{m-1}) + available_count[2^m]

But for m=0, the sum is available_count[2^0] (since 2^{m-1} is 2^{-1}, which is not considered. So for m=0, the sum is available_count[2^0].

So the algorithm for each x is:

Sort the exponents list by k in ascending order.

Compute max_m using the algorithm above.

For m in 0 to max_m:

   if m ==0:

       sum = available_count[2^0]

   else:

       sum = 2*(sum of available_count[2^0] + available_count[2^1] + ... + available_count[2^{m-1}]) + available_count[2^m]

   update the maximum sum.

But how to compute the sum of available counts for exponents 2^0 to 2^{m-1}.

We can precompute a prefix sum array for the exponents list.

For example, for x's exponents list sorted by k: [1,2,4,8], the prefix sum array would be [count_1, count_1+count_2, count_1+count_2+count_4, ...].

But for each m, the sum of available counts for exponents 2^0 to 2^{m-1} is the sum of the first m elements of the prefix sum array.

Wait, no. For m=2, the sum is count_1 + count_2.

For m=3, the sum is count_1 + count_2 + count_4.

So the prefix sum array can be built as follows:

prefix_sum[0] = count_1

prefix_sum[1] = count_1 + count_2

prefix_sum[2] = count_1 + count_2 + count_4

prefix_sum[k] = sum of counts for exponents 2^0 to 2^k.

So for m, the sum of exponents 2^0 to 2^{m-1} is prefix_sum[m-1].

So for each x, after sorting the exponents list by k, we can compute the prefix sum array.

Then, for each m in 0 to max_m:

   if m ==0:

       sum = count_1

   else:

       sum = 2 * prefix_sum[m-1] + count_2^m

   update the maximum sum.

So the steps are:

For each x in the array:

   collect all exponents e=2^k (k >=0) such that x^e is present in the array.

   sort the exponents by k in ascending order.

   if no exponents, skip.

   compute the prefix sum array.

   compute max_m using the algorithm.

   compute the prefix sum up to max_m.

   for m in 0 to max_m:

       if m ==0:

           current_sum = count_1

       else:

           current_sum = 2 * prefix_sum[m-1] + count_2^m

       update the global maximum.

So this approach is efficient.

Now, let's see how to implement this.

First, create a frequency map (count_dict) of the array elements.

Then, for each unique x in the array:

   collect all exponents e=2^k such that x^e is present in the array.

   To find these exponents, we can generate e=2^k for k=0,1,2,... until x^e exceeds the maximum possible element in the array.

   For each e=2^k:

       if x^e is in count_dict, add e to the exponents list.

   sort the exponents list by k in ascending order.

   if the exponents list is empty, skip.

   compute the prefix sum array.

   compute max_m.

   compute the possible sums for each m from 0 to max_m.

   update the global maximum.

So the code steps are:

from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def maximumLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count_dict = defaultdict(int)
        for num in nums:
            count_dict[num] +=1
        
        max_len = 0
        
        # Iterate over each unique x in nums
        for x in count_dict:
            # Collect all exponents e=2^k such that x^e is present in the array
            exponents = []
            current_e = 1  # 2^0
            while True:
                if x ** current_e in count_dict:
                    exponents.append(current_e)
                next_e = current_e * 2
                # Check if x^next_e would exceed the maximum possible value in the array
                # Since nums can have up to 1e9, x^next_e can be up to (1e9)^next_e, which is very large.
                # So we need to stop when x^next_e exceeds the maximum element in the array.
                # But how to find the maximum element in the array.
                # Alternatively, we can stop when x^next_e exceeds 1e9 (since the array elements are up to 1e9).
                # But this is not correct. For example, x=1, then x^e is always 1.
                # So we need to handle x=1 specially.
                # For x=1, all exponents e=2^k will have x^e=1. So if 1 is present in the array, then exponents can be any k.
                # But for x=1, the exponents are 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, etc. But x^e is 1 for any e.
                # So for x=1, if 1 is present, then exponents can be any e=2^k, but the exponents list will have e=1,2,4, etc., but x^e is 1 for all.
                # So for x=1, the exponents list will have e=1,2,4, etc., but x^e is 1, which is present.
                # So for x=1, the exponents list can be very long. But since the array elements are up to 1e9, x^e can be 1 for any e.
                # So for x=1, the exponents list can be generated until current_e exceeds 1e9.
                # But this is not feasible. So we need to handle x=1 separately.
                # For x=1, the exponents list is all e=2^k where 1^e is present. Since 1^e=1, if 1 is present, then all e's are present.
                # So for x=1, the exponents list is all e=2^k for k >=0, but we can generate up to e=1e9.
                # But this is not feasible. So for x=1, we can generate exponents until e exceeds 1e9.
                # But this can be done by checking if x^e is in count_dict. For x=1, x^e is 1, so if 1 is present, then all e's are present.
                # So for x=1, the exponents list is [1,2,4,8,...] up to e=1e9.
                # But this is not feasible. So for x=1, we can generate exponents until e exceeds 1e9.
                # But how to handle this.
                # For x=1, the exponents list is all e=2^k where 1^e is present. Since 1^e=1, if 1 is present, then all e's are present.
                # So for x=1, the exponents list is [1,2,4,8,...] up to e=1e9.
                # But generating this list is not feasible. So for x=1, we can generate exponents until e exceeds 1e9.
                # But how to do this.
                # For x=1, current_e starts at 1. We can generate e=1,2,4,8,... until e exceeds 1e9.
                # But this can be done with a loop.
                # For x=1, the loop will generate e=1,2,4,8,16,... until e exceeds 1e9.
                # But this can take up to log2(1e9) steps, which is about 30 steps. So it's manageable.
                # So for x=1, the loop can generate exponents until e exceeds 1e9.
                # For x>1, the loop can generate exponents until x^e exceeds 1e9.
                # So the code can be:

                    # So for m=0, exponents[0] is 1.

                    # For m=1, exponents[1] is 2.

                    # So the code for m>0 is:

                    # sum = 2*prefix_sum[m-1] + count_dict[x^{exponents[m]}]

                    # But how to get exponents[m]?

                    # exponents[m] is the exponent for 2^m.

                    # So for m=0, exponents[0] is 1.

                    # For m=1, exponents[1] is 2.

                    # So the code can be:

                    # For m in 0 to max_m:

                    # if m ==0:

                    #   current_sum = count_dict[x^1]

                    # else:

                    #   current_sum = 2*prefix_sum[m-1] + count_dict[x^{exponents[m]}]

                    # But how to get x^{exponents[m]}.

                    # exponents[m] is the exponent e=2^k. So x^e is x^{2^k}.

                    # So for exponents[m], x^e is x^{exponents[m]}.

                    # So count_dict[x^e] is count_dict.get(x**exponents[m], 0)

                    # So the code for m>0 is:

                    current_sum = 2 * prefix_sum[m-1] + count_dict.get(x ** exponents[m], 0)

                    # But wait, exponents[m] is 2^m. So x^exponents[m] is x^{2^m}.

                    # So for m=1, exponents[1] is 2, so x^2.

                    # So the code is correct.

                # Update max_len

                if current_sum > max_len:

                    max_len = current_sum

        return max_len

But wait, there's a problem with x=1. For x=1, the exponents list contains e=1,2,4,8,... up to 1e9. But when generating the exponents list, for x=1, the code generates e=1,2,4,8,... until e <=1e9. But x^e is 1 for any e. So if 1 is present in the array, then all exponents are present.

So for x=1, the exponents list will have e=1,2,4,8,... up to e=1e9.

But when sorting the exponents by k, they are sorted as 1,2,4,8,... which is correct.

Then, when computing max_m, the code iterates through the exponents list and checks if e == 2^m.

For x=1, exponents list is [1,2,4,8,...]. For each e in exponents:

e=1: 2^0=1 → m becomes 1.

e=2: 2^1=2 → m becomes 2.

e=4: 2^2=4 → m becomes 3.

and so on.

So max_m is m-1, which is the last m-1.

But for x=1, the exponents list can be very long. For example, if 1 is present in the array, then exponents list is [1,2,4,8,..., up to 1e9]. So the loop to compute max_m will iterate through all exponents, which can be up to 30 steps (since 2^30 is about 1e9).

So it's manageable.

But for x=1, the code will generate a very long exponents list, but the loop to compute max_m will stop after 30 steps.

So the code should handle x=1 correctly.

Now, let's test the code with the examples.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,4,1,2,2]

count_dict is {5:1,4:1,1:1,2:2}

For x=5:

exponents list is generated by checking 5^1=5 (present), 5^2=25 (not present). So exponents list is [1].

prefix_sum is [1].

max_m is 0.

For m=0: sum is 1. So current_sum is 1.

For x=4:

exponents list is generated by checking 4^1=4 (present), 4^2=16 (not present). So exponents list is [1].

prefix_sum is [1].

max_m is 0.

sum is 1.

For x=1:

exponents list is generated by checking 1^1=1 (present), 1^2=1 (present), etc. So exponents list is [1,2,4,8,... up to 1e9].

But in the array, 1 is present once.

So exponents list is [1,2,4,8,...], but count_dict[x^e] is 1 for e=1, and 0 for e>1.

So exponents list is [1,2,4,8,...], but only e=1 is present.

So during the exponents list generation:

current_e starts at 1.

x=1, so check if 1^1=1 is present. Yes. Add to exponents.

current_e *=2 → 2.

Check if 1^2=1 is present. Yes. Add to exponents.

current_e *=2 →4.

Check if 1^4=1 is present. Yes. Add to exponents.

And so on until current_e exceeds 1e9.

But in the array, only 1 is present. So for e=1, count_dict[1] is 1. For e=2, count_dict[1] is 1, but x^e is 1, which is present. So exponents list will have e=1,2,4,8,... up to 1e9.

But when generating the exponents list, for x=1, the code adds e to exponents if x^e is present. So for e=1, x^e=1 is present. For e=2, x^e=1 is present. So exponents list is [1,2,4,8,...].

But when building the prefix_sum array, for each e in exponents list, count_dict[x^e] is count_dict[1] =1.

So prefix_sum is [1, 2, 3, 4, ...].

But when computing max_m, the code iterates through exponents list:

e=1: 2^0=1 → m becomes 1.

e=2: 2^1=2 → m becomes 2.

e=4: 2^2=4 → m becomes 3.

e=8: 2^3=8 → m becomes 4.

and so on.

But since the exponents list is [1,2,4,8,...], the code will iterate through all exponents, and max_m will be m-1, which is the last m-1.

But for x=1, the exponents list is very long, but the code will process it until e exceeds 1e9.

But in reality, the code will generate exponents until current_e exceeds 1e9, which for x=1 is 1e9.

But for x=1, the code will generate exponents up to 1e9, which is 2^30 (since 2^30 is about 1e9). So the exponents list will have 30 elements.

But for each of these exponents, count_dict[x^e] is 1.

So the prefix_sum array will be [1, 2, 3, ..., 30].

max_m is 29 (since m starts at 0 and increments for each exponent).

Then, for each m from 0 to 29:

sum is 2*prefix_sum[m-1] + count_dict[1^{exponents[m]}] (which is 1).

For m=0: sum is 1.

For m=1: sum is 2*1 +1=3.

For m=2: sum is 2*(1+2) +1= 6+1=7.

...

But the maximum sum for x=1 is 30 (for m=29: sum is 2*prefix_sum[28] +1 = 2*(1+2+...+28) +1 = 2*(28*29/2) +1 = 28*29 +1= 812 +1=813. But this is not possible because the array has only one 1. So the code is incorrect.

Ah, here's a problem. For x=1, the code generates exponents list with e=1,2,4,8,... up to 1e9. But for each e in exponents list, x^e is 1, which is present once. So count_dict[x^e] is 1 for all e.

But the required count for each e in the sequence is 2 for e !=2^m, and 1 for e=2^m.

But for x=1, the sequence for m=29 would require 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^29. For each e=2^k (k <29), required count is 2. For e=2^29, required count is 1.

So the sum is 2*(sum of 1 for k=0 to 28) +1 = 2*29 +1=59.

But the array has only one 1. So the sum is min(1, 2) for each e=2^k (k<29), which is 1 for each. So the sum is 1*29 (for k<29) +1 (for k=29) =30.

But according to the code, the sum is 2*prefix_sum[m-1] + count_dict[x^e], which for m=29 is 2*prefix_sum[28] +1. prefix_sum[28] is 29 (sum of 1 for 29 elements). So 2*29 +1=59. But this is incorrect.

So the code is not handling x=1 correctly.

The problem is that for x=1, the exponents list contains e=1,2,4,8,... up to 1e9, but the array has only one 1. So for each e in the exponents list, x^e is 1, which has a count of 1.

But the required count for each e in the sequence is 2 for e !=2^m, and 1 for e=2^m.

So for m=29, the sum is 2*(sum of 1 for e=2^0 to 2^28) +1 (for e=2^29) = 2*29 +1=59. But the array has only one 1. So the sum should be min(1, 2) for each e=2^0 to 2^28 (which is 1 each) and min(1,1) for e=2^29. So sum is 29*1 +1=30.

But the code computes 59, which is incorrect.

So the code is not handling x=1 correctly.

The issue is that the code assumes that for each e in the exponents list, the count is available. But for x=1, the count is 1 for all e, but the required count for e !=2^m is 2. So the sum is min(1, 2) for each e !=2^m, which is 1. So the sum is the number of e's in the sequence.

But the code is summing 2*sum of available counts for e=0 to m-1, plus available count for e=m.

But for x=1, the available count for each e is 1. So the code's sum is 2*(m) +1, which is incorrect.

So the code is not handling x=1 correctly.

This is a critical error. So how to fix this.

The problem is that for x=1, the code generates exponents list with e=1,2,4,8,... up to 1e9, but the array has only one 1
