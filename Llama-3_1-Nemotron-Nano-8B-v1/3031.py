Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to compute a product matrix where each element is the product of all other elements in the grid, modulo 12345. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, the problem says that for each cell (i,j), the product is the product of all elements except grid[i][j]. Then take modulo 12345. The constraints are that the grid can be up to 1e5 elements in total (since n and m can each be up to 1e5, but their product is <=1e5). So the solution needs to be efficient, O(nm) time, otherwise it's going to be too slow.

The naive approach would be for each cell, multiply all other cells. But that's O(nm * nm) time, which is 1e10 operations if nm is 1e5. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter way.

Hmm, the standard approach for such problems (like product of array except self) is to compute prefix and suffix products. Let's see if that can be adapted here.

In the 1D case, for each element, the product is the product of all elements to the left multiplied by the product of all elements to the right. So for a 2D grid, maybe we can compute for each row, the product of all elements in the row except the current one, and then do something similar for columns. Wait, but the problem requires the product of all elements except the current one in the entire grid. So it's not just row or column-wise.

Wait, the product for cell (i,j) is the product of all elements in the grid except grid[i][j]. So the product is the total product of the entire grid divided by grid[i][j], but only if grid[i][j] is not zero. But since the problem states that grid[i][j] is at least 1, division is possible. However, since we are working modulo 12345, division isn't straightforward. Because division modulo a number is equivalent to multiplying by the modular inverse. But 12345 is not a prime. Let's check: 12345 factors into 5 * 2469, but 2469 is 3*823. So 12345 = 3*5*823. Since 12345 is composite, not all elements have inverses modulo 12345. So division isn't possible in general. So that approach might not work.

So the division approach is not feasible here. So we need another way.

Alternative approach: Compute the product of all elements in the grid, then for each element, the product is (total_product / grid[i][j]) mod 12345. But again, division is a problem. So this approach is only possible if grid[i][j] and 12345 are coprime, which they might not be.

So that's not reliable. So we need a way to compute the product without division.

Another idea: For each element, compute the product of all elements except itself. How?

In 1D, the product except self can be done with prefix and suffix products. For 2D, perhaps we can compute the product of all elements in the grid except those in the same row and column. Wait, no. Because the product is all elements except the current cell. So for each cell (i,j), the product is the product of all elements in the grid divided by grid[i][j]. But again, division is a problem.

Wait, but maybe the total product can be computed, and then for each element, multiply the total product by the modular inverse of grid[i][j] modulo 12345. But again, the inverse exists only if grid[i][j] and 12345 are coprime. So if grid[i][j] has a common factor with 12345, then the inverse doesn't exist, and this approach would fail.

So this approach is not feasible for all cases.

Hmm. So what's the alternative?

Let's think of the problem in terms of the product of all elements except the current one. For each element, the product is the product of all elements in the grid divided by that element. But since division is not possible, perhaps we can precompute the product of all elements, and then for each element, compute (product * inverse(element)) mod 12345. But again, the inverse may not exist.

Wait, but the problem requires the product modulo 12345. So even if the element is not coprime with 12345, perhaps we can compute the product modulo 12345 first, then multiply by the inverse if possible, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the product of all elements modulo 12345 can be computed, and then for each element, the product is (total_product * inverse(element)) mod 12345. But again, the inverse may not exist. So this approach would work only when all elements are coprime with 12345, which is not guaranteed.

So this approach is not reliable.

So what's another way?

Let's think of the problem as follows: For each cell (i,j), the product is the product of all elements in the grid except grid[i][j]. So the product is the product of all elements, divided by grid[i][j]. But since we can't do division, perhaps we can compute the product for each cell by multiplying all elements except that cell. But that's O(nm * nm) time, which is not feasible.

But given the constraints (n*m <=1e5), even O(nm) is acceptable, but O(nm * (n+m)) might be too slow. For example, if n and m are each 1e5, but their product is 1e5, then n and m can't be that big. Wait, the constraints say 1 <= n == grid.length <= 1e5, 1 <= m == grid[i].length <=1e5, but n*m <=1e5. So the maximum possible nm is 1e5. So for example, if n is 1e5, then m is 1. So the total elements are 1e5. So for each element, multiplying all others would be O(1e5) per element, leading to O(1e10) operations, which is way too slow.

So that's not feasible.

So we need a way to compute the product for each cell in O(1) time, after some pre-processing.

Alternative idea: Precompute the product of all elements in the grid. Then for each cell (i,j), the product is (total_product // grid[i][j]) mod 12345. But again, division is a problem. But since the elements can be up to 1e9, and the product can be very large, even if we could compute the product, storing it is impossible. So this approach is not feasible.

Wait, but the problem requires the product modulo 12345. So perhaps we can compute the total product modulo 12345, and then for each element, compute (total_product * inverse(grid[i][j])) mod 12345. But again, the inverse may not exist.

So let's think: when is the inverse of a number a modulo m exists? It exists if and only if a and m are coprime. So for each grid[i][j], if grid[i][j] and 12345 are coprime, then the inverse exists. Otherwise, it doesn't.

But 12345 factors into 3 * 5 * 823. So any number that is not divisible by 3, 5, or 823 will have an inverse. But if a number is divisible by any of these primes, then it's not coprime with 12345, so the inverse doesn't exist.

So in such cases, the approach of multiplying by the inverse would fail.

So this approach is not reliable.

Hmm. So what's another way?

Alternative approach: For each cell (i,j), compute the product of all elements except grid[i][j] by multiplying all elements in the grid, but subtract the contribution of grid[i][j]. But again, since we can't divide, this is not possible.

Wait, but maybe the product can be computed as the product of all elements except grid[i][j] by using the product of the entire grid, and then for each element, multiply the product by the inverse of grid[i][j]. But again, the inverse may not exist.

So perhaps the problem requires that the product is computed as (total_product * inverse(grid[i][j])) mod 12345, but when the inverse doesn't exist, the result is undefined. But the problem statement says that the input can have any integers >=1, so we have to handle cases where the inverse doesn't exist.

So this approach is not feasible.

Hmm. So perhaps the key is to compute the product of all elements modulo 12345, and then for each element, compute (product * inverse) mod 12345, but only if the inverse exists. But how to handle when the inverse doesn't exist?

Wait, but in the example 2, the input is [12345, 2, 1]. The total product is 12345 * 2 * 1 = 24690. 24690 mod 12345 is 0. So for the first element (12345), the product is (24690 / 12345) = 2. But 24690 mod 12345 is 0, so 0 * inverse(12345) mod 12345. But 12345 mod 12345 is 0, so inverse(0) is undefined. So this approach would fail here.

But in the example, the correct answer is 2. So how is that possible? Because the total product is 24690, which mod 12345 is 0. So when you divide by 12345, you get 2, which mod 12345 is 2. But how to compute that when the total product mod 12345 is 0.

So in this case, the product is 0, and the element is 12345. So 0 divided by 12345 is 0, but in the example, the correct answer is 2. So this approach is not working.

Wait, the example 2's input is [[12345], [2], [1]]. So the grid is a 3x1 matrix. The product of all elements except the first (which is 12345) is 2*1=2. The product of all elements except the second (2) is 12345*1=12345 mod 12345 is 0. Similarly for the third element. So the output is [[2], [0], [0]].

But the total product of all elements is 12345 * 2 * 1 = 24690. 24690 mod 12345 is 0. So for the first element, the product is 24690 / 12345 = 2. But 24690 mod 12345 is 0, so 0 divided by 12345 is 0, but the correct answer is 2. So this approach of using the total product mod 12345 and then dividing by the element mod 12345 is not correct.

So this approach is invalid.

So we need a different approach.

Alternative idea: For each cell (i,j), the product is the product of all elements in the grid except grid[i][j]. So the product is the product of all elements, divided by grid[i][j]. But since division is not possible, perhaps we can compute the product for each cell by multiplying all elements except that cell. But how to do this efficiently.

But with the constraints of nm up to 1e5, and each cell requiring O(nm) time, this is O(1e10) operations, which is way too slow.

So this is not feasible.

Hmm. So what's the alternative?

Wait, perhaps the problem can be broken down into rows and columns. For example, for each row, compute the product of all elements in the row except the current one, and then for each column, compute the product of all elements in the column except the current one, and then multiply the row and column products. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think: the product for cell (i,j) is the product of all elements in the grid except grid[i][j]. So that's the product of all elements in row i except grid[i][j], multiplied by the product of all elements in the other rows. But that's not correct. Because the product of all elements except grid[i][j] is the product of all elements in the grid divided by grid[i][j]. So this approach would not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the product can be computed as the product of all elements in the grid, divided by grid[i][j]. But again, division is a problem.

So perhaps the key is to compute the product of all elements in the grid, and then for each element, compute (product // grid[i][j]) mod 12345. But how to compute this when the product is very large.

But even if we compute the product modulo 12345, then (product * inverse(grid[i][j])) mod 12345 would give the correct result only if grid[i][j] and 12345 are coprime. Otherwise, it's not possible.

So this approach is not reliable.

Hmm. So what's the correct way to compute this?

Let me think of the problem again. The product for each cell (i,j) is the product of all elements except grid[i][j]. So the product is the product of all elements in the grid divided by grid[i][j]. But since we can't do division, perhaps we can precompute the product of all elements, and then for each element, compute (product // grid[i][j]) mod 12345. But how to compute this when the product is very large.

But even if the product is very large, we can compute it modulo 12345. But then, when we divide by grid[i][j], the result may not be correct. For example, in the first example, the product is 1*2*3*4=24. 24 mod 12345 is 24. Then for each element, 24 / grid[i][j] mod 12345. For grid[0][0] (1), 24/1=24 mod 12345 is 24. But the correct answer is 24. So that works. For grid[0][1] (2), 24/2=12 mod 12345 is 12. Correct. So this works here.

In example 2, the product is 12345 * 2 * 1 = 24690. 24690 mod 12345 is 0. So for the first element (12345), 0 / 12345 mod 12345 is 0, but the correct answer is 2. So this approach fails here.

So the problem is that when the product is a multiple of 12345, then the modulo is zero, and division by the element (even if it's a divisor) may not give the correct result.

So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. So what's the alternative?

Alternative idea: For each cell (i,j), compute the product of all elements except grid[i][j] by first computing the product of all elements, then subtract the logarithm of grid[i][j], then exponentiate. But this is not feasible with integers and modulo operations. Also, logarithms are not precise enough for this purpose.

So that's not a viable approach.

Another idea: Since the problem requires the product modulo 12345, perhaps we can compute the product of all elements modulo 12345, and then for each element, compute (product * inverse(grid[i][j])) mod 12345. But as discussed earlier, this only works if grid[i][j] and 12345 are coprime. Otherwise, the inverse doesn't exist, and this approach fails.

But in example 2, the product mod 12345 is 0. So for the first element (12345), which is 0 mod 12345, the inverse doesn't exist. So this approach would fail.

But in the example, the correct answer is 2. So how can we compute that?

Wait, the product of all elements except the first is 2*1=2. So the product is 2 mod 12345 is 2. So the correct answer is 2. But the total product mod 12345 is 0, which is not helpful.

So the problem is that the total product mod 12345 is zero, but the product of the other elements is not zero. So the approach of using the total product mod 12345 and then dividing by the element is not correct.

So this suggests that the approach of using the total product mod 12345 and then multiplying by the inverse is not correct in all cases.

So what's the correct way to compute this?

Alternative approach: For each cell (i,j), compute the product of all elements except grid[i][j] by multiplying all elements in the grid, but subtract the current element. But how to do this efficiently.

But with nm up to 1e5, this would be O(nm) time for each cell, leading to O(1e10) operations, which is not feasible.

So this is not possible.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem requires a different approach. Let's think of the grid as a list of elements. For each element, the product is the product of all elements except that one. So the product is the product of the entire grid divided by the element. But since division is not possible, perhaps we can compute the product for each element by multiplying all elements except that one. But how to do this efficiently.

Wait, but the product of all elements except the current one can be computed as the product of the elements before the current one multiplied by the product of the elements after the current one. This is the approach used in the 1D product except self problem.

But in 2D, how to apply this?

Wait, the grid is a 2D array, but the product is for the entire grid. So for each element, the product is the product of all elements in the grid except that element. So the product is the same as the product of all elements in the grid divided by the current element. But again, division is a problem.

So perhaps the key is to compute the product of all elements in the grid, and then for each element, compute (product // element) mod 12345. But how to compute this when the product is very large.

But even if the product is very large, we can compute it modulo 12345. But then, when we divide by the element, the result may not be correct. For example, in example 2, the product mod 12345 is 0, and the element is 12345. So 0 divided by 12345 is 0, but the correct answer is 2.

So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. So what's the correct way to compute this?

Alternative idea: For each element, compute the product of all elements except itself by first computing the product of all elements, then subtract the logarithm of the element, then exponentiate.

So that's not a viable approach.

But this only works if element and 12345 are coprime. Otherwise, the inverse doesn't exist, and this approach fails.

But in example 2, the element 12345 is not coprime with 12345 (since 12345 mod 12345 is 0, which is not coprime with anything). So the inverse doesn't exist, and this approach fails.

But the correct answer for that element is 2, which is (2*1) mod 12345. So how can we compute that?

Hmm. So perhaps the problem requires that we compute the product of all elements except the current one, but without using division. So the only way is to compute the product for each element by multiplying all other elements. But with nm up to 1e5, this is O(nm * (n*m)) time, which is 1e10 operations. That's way too slow.

But wait, the constraints say that n and m can be up to 1e5, but their product is at most 1e5. So for example, if n is 1e5, then m is 1. So the total elements are 1e5. So for each element, multiplying all others would be O(1e5) per element, leading to O(1e10) operations. Which is way too slow.

So this approach is not feasible.

So what's the correct way to compute this?

So this approach is not feasible.

So what's the correct way to compute this?

Wait, perhaps there's a mathematical trick here. Let's think about the problem again.

The product for each cell (i,j) is the product of all elements in the grid except grid[i][j]. So the product is the product of all elements divided by grid[i][j]. But since division is not possible, perhaps we can compute the product for each cell as the product of all elements multiplied by the inverse of grid[i][j], but only if the inverse exists. Otherwise, the product is zero.

But how to determine when the inverse exists.

Alternatively, perhaps the product can be computed as follows:

Compute the product of all elements in the grid. Then, for each element, if the element is zero, then the product for that cell is the product of all other elements. But since the problem states that grid[i][j] is at least 1, there are no zeros. So that's not applicable.

Hmm. So the problem is that when the product of all elements is a multiple of 12345, then the modulo is zero, and dividing by the element (even if it's a divisor) may not give the correct result.

But in example 2, the product is 12345 * 2 * 1 = 24690. 24690 mod 12345 is 0. So for the first element (12345), the product is 24690 / 12345 = 2. But 24690 mod 12345 is 0, so 0 divided by 12345 is 0, but the correct answer is 2.

So this approach is not correct.

So what's the correct way to compute this?

Alternative idea: For each cell (i,j), compute the product of all elements except grid[i][j] by first computing the product of all elements, then subtract the logarithm of grid[i][j], then exponentiate.

So that's not a viable approach.

Hmm. So I'm stuck. Let's think of the problem again.

The product for each cell is the product of all elements except that cell. So the product is the product of the entire grid divided by the cell's value. But since division is not possible, perhaps we can compute the product for each cell by multiplying all elements except that cell. But how to do this efficiently.

But with nm up to 1e5, this is O(nm) time for each cell, leading to O(1e10) operations. Which is not feasible.

So this approach is not possible.

Wait, but perhaps there's a way to compute the product for all cells in O(nm) time.

Let me think: For each row, compute the product of all elements in the row. Then, for each cell (i,j), the product is the product of all rows' products except the j-th element of row i, multiplied by the product of all elements in other rows. No, that's not correct. Because the product of all elements except (i,j) is the product of all elements in the grid divided by grid[i][j]. So this approach would not work.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the product of all elements in the grid, and then for each cell, compute (product // grid[i][j]) mod 12345. But how to compute this when the product is very large.

But even if the product is very large, we can compute it modulo 12345. But then, when we divide by grid[i][j], the result may not be correct. For example, in example 2, the product mod 12345 is 0. So 0 divided by 12345 is 0, but the correct answer is 2.

So this approach is not feasible.

So I'm stuck. What's the correct approach here?

Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that the product of all elements except grid[i][j] is equal to the product of all elements in the grid multiplied by the inverse of grid[i][j], but only if the inverse exists. Otherwise, the product is zero. But how to handle cases where the inverse doesn't exist.

But in example 2, the product of all elements is 24690, which is 0 mod 12345. So for the first element (12345), the product is 24690 / 12345 = 2. But 24690 mod 12345 is 0, so 0 divided by 12345 is 0. So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem requires that we compute the product of all elements except the current one, but without using division. So the only way is to compute the product for each cell by multiplying all other elements. But with nm up to 1e5, this is O(nm) time for each cell, leading to O(1e10) operations. Which is not feasible.

But wait, perhaps there's a way to compute the product for all cells in O(nm) time.

Let me think: For each cell (i,j), the product is the product of all elements in the grid divided by grid[i][j]. So if we can compute the product of all elements, then for each cell, compute (product // grid[i][j]) mod 12345. But how to compute this when the product is very large.

But even if the product is very large, we can compute it modulo 12345. But then, when we divide by grid[i][j], the result may not be correct. For example, in example 2, the product mod 12345 is 0. So 0 divided by 12345 is 0, but the correct answer is 2.

Which is not feasible.

But given the constraints, perhaps the problem expects us to use this approach, but with some optimizations.

Wait, but nm is up to 1e5. So for each cell, multiplying all other elements would be O(nm) time. So total time is O(nm * nm) = 1e10 operations, which is way too slow. So this is not feasible.

So I'm stuck. What's the correct approach here?

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to use the product of all elements modulo 12345, and then for each element, compute (product * inverse(element)) mod 12345. But when the inverse doesn't exist, the result is zero. But this is not correct in all cases.

But in example 2, the product mod 12345 is 0. So for the first element, the inverse of 12345 mod 12345 is undefined. So the result is zero, but the correct answer is 2. So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. So what's the correct way to compute this?

Alternative idea: For each cell (i,j), compute the product of all elements except grid[i][j] by first computing the product of all elements, then subtract the logarithm of grid[i][j], then exponentiate.

But this only works if element and 12345 are coprime. Otherwise, the inverse doesn't exist, and the result is undefined. But the problem requires that the answer is correct for all possible inputs.

So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. So I'm stuck. What's the correct way to compute this?

Another idea: Since the problem requires the product modulo 12345, perhaps we can compute the product of all elements modulo 12345, and then for each element, compute (product * inverse(element)) mod 12345.

Hmm. So I'm stuck. What's the correct way to compute this?

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to use the product of all elements modulo 12345, and then for each element, compute (product * inverse(element)) mod 12345. But when the inverse doesn't exist, the result is zero. But this is not correct in all cases.

But in example 2, the product mod 12345 is 0. So for the first element, the inverse of 12345 mod 12345 is undefined. So the result is zero, but the correct answer is 2. So this approach is not correct.

But this is not feasible with integers and modulo operations. Also, logarithms are not precise enough for this purpose.

Another idea: Since the problem requires the product modulo 12345, perhaps we can compute the product of all elements modulo 12345, and then for each element, compute (product * inverse(element)) mod 12345. But this only works if element and 12345 are coprime. Otherwise, the inverse doesn't exist, and the result is undefined. But the problem requires that the answer is correct for all possible inputs.

So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. So I'm stuck. What's the correct way to compute this?

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to use the product of all elements modulo 12345, and then for each element, compute (product * inverse(element)) mod 12345. But when the inverse doesn't exist, the result is zero. But this is not correct in all cases.

But in example 2, the product mod 12345 is 0. So for the first element, the inverse of 12345 mod 12345 is undefined. So the result is zero, but the correct answer is 2. So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. So what's the correct way to compute this?

Alternative idea: For each cell (i,j), compute the product of all elements except grid[i][j] by first computing the product of all elements, then subtract the logarithm of grid[i][j], then exponentiate. But this is not feasible with integers and modulo operations. Also, logarithms are not precise enough for this purpose.

So that's not a viable approach.

Another idea: Since the problem requires the product modulo 12345, perhaps we can compute the product of all elements modulo 12345, and then for each element, compute (product * inverse(element)) mod 12345. But this only works if element and 12345 are coprime. Otherwise, the inverse doesn't exist, and the result is undefined. But the problem requires that the answer is correct for all possible inputs.

So this approach is not correct.
