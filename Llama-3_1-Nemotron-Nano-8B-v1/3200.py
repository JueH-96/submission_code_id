Okay, let's see. I need to find the number of good strings of length n. A good string is one that can be rearranged to have "leet" as a substring. Hmm. So the key is that after rearrangement, the string must contain "leet" as a contiguous substring. But since rearrangement is allowed, the order doesn't matter except for the presence of the necessary characters in the right counts.

Wait, the substring "leet" has the letters l, e, e, t. So to form "leet" as a substring, the rearranged string must have at least one l, two e's, and one t. But since the substring is contiguous, those four characters must be present in the string. Wait, but the original string's length is n. So for n <4, it's impossible. But the constraints say n >=1. So for n <4, the answer is 0. But the examples start with n=4.

So first, the problem is to count all possible strings of length n (composed of lowercase letters) that have at least the counts required to form "leet" as a substring. But since rearrangement is allowed, the actual condition is that the string has at least the required counts for each character in "leet", and the total length is at least 4. Wait, no. Because even if the string has more than the required counts, but after rearrangement, there's a substring "leet".

Wait, but when you rearrange the characters, you can arrange them in any order. So the presence of the letters l, e (twice), t, and at least one more character (if n>4) is needed. Wait, no. For example, in the first example, n=4. The string must have exactly one l, two e's, one t. So the total letters are 4. So any permutation of those letters that includes "leet" as a substring. But since rearrangement is allowed, the string is considered good if it has at least the required counts. Because you can arrange the letters to form "leet" as a substring. For example, the string "eelt" can be rearranged to "leet", which includes "leet" as the entire string. So the key is that the string must have at least the counts of each character in "leet", and the total length is at least 4. Wait, but "leet" has l:1, e:2, t:1. So the original string must have at least 1 l, 2 e's, 1 t, and the remaining characters (n-4) can be any letters, but they can't interfere with the ability to form the substring. Wait, but when you rearrange, you can have the "leet" substring and then the other characters. For example, if n=5, the string could be "leetc", which when rearranged as "leetc" has "leet" as the first four characters. So the other character (c) can be any letter, but the counts for l, e, t must be at least 1, 2, 1 respectively. Wait, but the other characters can be anything. So the problem reduces to: the string must have at least 1 l, 2 e's, 1 t, and the remaining (n-4) characters can be any letters (including more l's, e's, t's, or other letters). Because even if there are more, you can arrange the required letters into the "leet" substring and the rest can be placed anywhere else.

So the total number of good strings is equal to the number of strings of length n that have at least 1 l, 2 e's, 1 t, and the remaining (n-4) characters can be any of the 26 letters. But wait, the remaining characters can include l, e, t, or others. So the counts for l, e, t can be more than required. For example, if n=5, the string could have 2 l's, 3 e's, 1 t, and 1 other. Then, when rearranged, you can have "leet" followed by the other characters. So the presence of the required letters in sufficient numbers is the key.

So the problem is to compute the number of strings of length n that have at least 1 l, 2 e's, 1 t, and the remaining (n-4) characters can be any letters. But how do we model this?

The approach is to calculate the total number of possible strings that meet the required counts. Then subtract the cases where the counts are insufficient.

But how to compute this? Let's think in terms of combinatorics.

The total number of possible strings of length n is 26^n. But we need to subtract the strings that don't meet the required counts.

But the required counts are:

- l >=1
- e >=2
- t >=1
- The sum of l, e, t, and other letters (if any) is n.

Wait, but the other letters can be any letters, including l, e, t. So the counts for l, e, t can be more than the required minimums.

So the problem is to compute the number of strings where the count of l is at least 1, e is at least 2, t is at least 1, and the total length is n.

So the formula would be:

sum_{l=1 to ...} sum_{e=2 to ...} sum_{t=1 to ...} [ (l + e + t + o) = n ] * (26^{o}) * (number of ways to arrange the letters l, e, t, and o letters which can be any of the 26 letters, but with the constraints on l, e, t).

Wait, no. Because the o letters are the remaining letters (n - l - e - t) in count. But each of those o letters can be any of the 26 letters, including l, e, t. So the total number of ways for the o letters is 26^{o}.

But the main thing is that the counts l, e, t must be at least 1, 2, 1 respectively, and the sum l + e + t + o = n. Wait, no. Because the o is the sum of the other letters. Wait, no. Let me rephrase.

The total number of letters is l (number of l's) + e (number of e's) + t (number of t's) + other_letters (sum of counts of all other 23 letters) = n.

But other_letters can be any of the 23 letters (since l, e, t are already accounted for). Wait, no. The other letters can include l, e, t. For example, if the string has 2 l's, 3 e's, 1 t, and 1 a, then the other_letters is 1 a. But if the string has 2 l's, 3 e's, 1 t, and 1 l, then the other_letters would be 1 l, but that's part of the l count. Wait, no. The l count is the total number of l's in the string. So the other_letters are the letters that are not l, e, or t. So the o is the sum of the counts of the other 23 letters.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

The string can have any letters. But to form the "leet" substring, we need at least 1 l, 2 e's, 1 t. The remaining letters (n - (1 + 2 + 1)) = n-4 can be any letters, including l, e, t, or others. So the counts for l can be 1 or more, e can be 2 or more, t can be 1 or more, and the rest can be any letters (including more l, e, t, or others).

So the problem is to compute the number of multisets of letters where:

- l >=1
- e >=2
- t >=1
- sum of all letters is n.

But each letter in the multiset can be any of the 26 letters, but the counts for l, e, t must be at least 1, 2, 1 respectively.

Wait, but the other letters (non-l, e, t) can be any of the 23 letters. So the total number of possible combinations is the sum over all possible l, e, t (with l >=1, e >=2, t >=1) and o >=0 (sum of other letters) such that l + e + t + o = n. For each such combination, the number of ways is:

C(n, l, e, t, o) * (23^o) * (1^l) * (1^e) * (1^t) ?

Wait, no. Because the letters are arranged in any order. But since we are considering the counts, the number of distinct strings is the multinomial coefficient multiplied by the possibilities for the other letters.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as:

The total number of good strings is equal to the number of ways to choose the counts of each character such that:

- l >=1, e >=2, t >=1
- sum of all counts (l + e + t + ... ) = n

For each such combination, the number of distinct strings is (n!)/(l! e! t! ... ) * (23^o), where o is the sum of the counts of the other 23 letters. Wait, no. Because the other letters can be any of the 23 letters, and each of their counts can be anything. So for the other 23 letters, each can have a count of 0 or more, and the sum of their counts is o = n - (l + e + t). So the number of ways to choose the counts for the other letters is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to x1 + x2 + ... + x23 = o, which is C(o + 23 -1, 23-1) = C(o +22, 22). But for each of those 23 letters, each occurrence can be any of the 23 letters, but the counts are determined by the x_i. Wait, no. The counts for the other letters are x1, x2, ..., x23, where each x_i is the count of the i-th other letter. The total number of ways to assign the counts is the multinomial coefficient for the other letters. But when considering the actual letters, each of the x_i positions can be any of the 23 letters. Wait, no. Because the x_i is the count for each of the 23 letters. So the number of ways to distribute the o letters into the 23 other letters is the same as the number of multisets of size o with elements from 23 options, which is C(o +23 -1, 23-1) = C(o+22, 22). But each of those letters can be any of the 23, so for each of the o positions, we can choose which of the 23 letters it is. But that's equivalent to 23^o. Wait, no. Because 23^o counts all possible sequences of o letters, each of which can be any of the 23. But in our case, the order of the letters in the string is irrelevant because we are considering the multiset counts. Wait, no. Because the problem is about the number of distinct strings. So the order matters. Wait, but the problem counts the number of distinct strings. So for example, the string "aabb" is different from "abab" even though they have the same counts. So the total number of strings is 26^n, because each position can be any of the 26 letters. But when we have constraints on the counts, the number of valid strings is the sum over all valid count combinations of (n! / (product of factorials of each count)) multiplied by the product of the possibilities for each character. Wait, perhaps that's the right approach.

So the correct way to model this is:

The number of good strings is equal to the sum over all possible counts of each character (c_l, c_e, c_t, c_a1, c_a2, ..., c_a23) where:

c_l >=1, c_e >=2, c_t >=1, and sum of all c_i = n.

For each such combination, the number of distinct strings is (n! ) / (c_l! * c_e! * c_t! * product of c_ai! for each of the 23 other letters) ) multiplied by the product of the possibilities for each character. Wait, but each character's count is determined. For example, the count for 'l' is c_l, which is >=1. The count for 'e' is c_e >=2, etc. The other 23 letters can have any counts (including zero), but their sum is o = n - (c_l + c_e + c_t).

But how do we model this? It's a bit complicated. Let's think of it as:

The problem can be broken down into two parts:

1. Choose the counts for l, e, t such that c_l >=1, c_e >=2, c_t >=1, and the sum s = c_l + c_e + c_t <=n.

2. The remaining o = n - s characters can be any of the 23 other letters. For each of these o characters, they can be any of the 23 letters, and their counts can be anything (including zero). So the number of ways to arrange these o characters is 23^o multiplied by the multinomial coefficient for their distribution. Wait, no. Because the order of the entire string is considered. So the total number of strings is the product of the multinomial coefficients for the l, e, t, and the other letters.

Alternatively, the total number of strings is equal to:

sum_{c_l >=1, c_e >=2, c_t >=1, s = c_l + c_e + c_t <=n} [ (n! / (c_l! c_e! c_t! o! )) * (23^o) ) ] * (number of ways to distribute the o letters into 23 categories) ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think again. The total number of strings is the sum over all possible combinations of counts for each character (including l, e, t, and the others) that meet the constraints. For each such combination, the number of distinct strings is (n! ) / (product of (count of each character)! ) multiplied by the product of the possibilities for each character. But for the other 23 letters, each can be any of the 23 letters, but their counts are part of the combination.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

The number of good strings is equal to the sum over all possible c_l >=1, c_e >=2, c_t >=1, and o >=0 (sum of other letters) such that c_l + c_e + c_t + o =n, of:

( (26^o) * (number of ways to arrange the letters) )

But the number of ways to arrange the letters is the multinomial coefficient: n! / (c_l! * c_e! * c_t! * (product of the counts of the other 23 letters)!) )

But this seems computationally infeasible for large n, as we can't iterate over all possible combinations.

So we need a smarter way to compute this.

Alternative approach: inclusion-exclusion.

The total number of strings that have at least 1 l, 2 e's, 1 t, and the rest can be any letters.

But how to compute this?

The inclusion-exclusion approach would subtract the cases where the counts are insufficient. But perhaps it's easier to model this as:

The total number of valid strings is equal to the sum over all possible counts of l, e, t, and other letters, such that l >=1, e >=2, t >=1, and sum to n. For each such combination, the number of strings is (n! / (l! e! t! ... )) * (23^o), where o is the sum of the counts of the other 23 letters. But again, this is not feasible for large n.

Wait, but perhaps we can model this using generating functions.

The generating function for the letters l, e, t is:

For l: x + x^2 + x^3 + ... = x/(1 -x)

For e: x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + ... = x^2/(1 -x)

For t: x + x^2 + x^3 + ... = x/(1 -x)

For the other 23 letters: each can contribute 0 or more, so their generating function is (1 + x + x^2 + ... )^23 = 1/(1 -x)^23. But each of these letters can be any of 23 options, so the generating function for the counts is (sum_{k=0}^infty (23 * x^k )) )^23? Wait, no. Because for each of the other letters, the count can be any non-negative integer, and each occurrence can be any of the 23 letters. So the generating function for each of the other letters is sum_{k=0}^\infty (23 * x^k) ), but that's not correct. Because for each occurrence, there are 23 choices. So the generating function for a single other letter is sum_{k=0}^\infty (23 * x^k) )? No, that's not right. Because for each occurrence, the choice is 23 options. So the generating function for a single other letter is sum_{k=0}^\infty (23^k x^k) ), but that's not correct either. Wait, no. For example, if we have a single other letter, say 'a', then the generating function for the count of 'a's is sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k, because each 'a' contributes 1 to the count. But since there are 23 other letters, each can have any count. So the generating function for the sum of the counts of the other letters is (sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k )^23. But each of the other letters can be any of the 23, so the total number of ways to have a sum of o letters is 23^o multiplied by the number of ways to distribute o indistinct items into 23 distinct boxes (which is C(o +23 -1, 23-1) = C(o+22, 22)). Wait, but this is the same as the generating function (1/(1 -x))^23. So the generating function for the other letters is (1/(1 -x))^23.

But how does this fit into the overall generating function?

The overall generating function for the problem is:

(l's generating function) * (e's generating function) * (t's generating function) * (other's generating function) * (number of ways to arrange the letters).

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think again.

The generating function for the counts of l, e, t, and others is:

For l: x + x^2 + x^3 + ... = x/(1 -x)

For e: x^2 + x^3 + ... = x^2/(1 -x)

For t: x + x^2 + ... = x/(1 -x)

For others: (1/(1 -x))^23 (since each of the 23 letters can have any count, and the sum is the total count of other letters)

But the total count is the sum of l, e, t, and others. So the generating function for the sum is:

(x/(1-x)) * (x^2/(1-x)) * (x/(1-x)) * (1/(1-x))^23) = x^(1+2+1) * (1/(1-x))^(1+1+23) ) = x^4 * (1/(1-x))^25.

But this represents the generating function for the sum of the counts. However, each term in the generating function represents the number of ways to have a certain total count. But the actual number of strings is more than that. Because for each combination of counts, the number of distinct strings is (n! ) / (product of factorials of each count) multiplied by the product of the possibilities for each character. Wait, perhaps not. Because the letters are arranged in any order, but the counts are fixed. So the number of distinct strings for a given set of counts is (n! ) / (product of (count_i! )) ), where count_i is the count of each character. But in our case, the counts are:

- l: c_l (>=1)
- e: c_e (>=2)
- t: c_t (>=1)
- others: sum of c_ai (each >=0)

So the total number of strings for a given set of counts is:

(n! ) / (c_l! * c_e! * c_t! * product (c_ai! )) )

But the product (c_ai! ) is the product of the factorials of the counts of the other 23 letters. However, the sum of the c_ai is o = n - (c_l + c_e + c_t). So the product of the c_ai! is the product of the factorials of the counts of each of the 23 other letters.

But how do we model this in generating functions? It's getting complicated.

Alternative approach: Let's model the problem as follows.

The total number of good strings is equal to the sum over all possible c_l >=1, c_e >=2, c_t >=1, and o >=0 (sum of other letters) such that c_l + c_e + c_t + o =n, of:

( (n! ) / (c_l! * c_e! * c_t! * product (c_ai! )) ) * (23^o) )

But this is because:

- The n! / (product of factorials) is the multinomial coefficient for arranging the letters.

- The 23^o is because each of the o other letters can be any of the 23 possible letters (since they are not l, e, or t).

But the product (c_ai! ) is the product of the factorials of the counts of each of the 23 other letters. However, the sum of the c_ai is o. So the product of the c_ai! is the product of the factorials of the counts of each of the 23 letters. But how do we compute this sum over all possible c_ai?

This seems very challenging. So perhaps we need to find a generating function approach that can model this.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using exponential generating functions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think of the problem as follows:

The number of good strings is equal to the sum over all possible c_l >=1, c_e >=2, c_t >=1, and o >=0 (sum of other letters) such that c_l + c_e + c_t + o =n, of:

( (n! ) / (c_l! * c_e! * c_t! * o! )) * (23^o) * (number of ways to split o into 23 parts) )

But the number of ways to split o into 23 parts (each part >=0) is C(o +23 -1, 23-1) = C(o+22, 22). So the term becomes:

(n! / (c_l! c_e! c_t! o! )) * 23^o * C(o +22, 22)

But this seems complicated. However, perhaps we can find a generating function that represents this.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using the inclusion-exclusion principle. Let's think of the total number of strings that have at least 1 l, 2 e's, 1 t, and the rest can be any letters. The total is equal to:

sum_{c_l=1}^\infty sum_{c_e=2}^\infty sum_{c_t=1}^\infty [ (n - c_l -c_e -c_t) >=0 ] * (n! / (c_l! c_e! c_t! (n - c_l -c_e -c_t)! )) * 23^{n - c_l -c_e -c_t} }

But this is the same as:

sum_{s=4}^n sum_{c_l=1}^{s-2} sum_{c_e=2}^{s -c_l -1} sum_{c_t=1}^{s -c_l -c_e} [ (s - c_l -c_e -c_t) = o ] * (n! / (c_l! c_e! c_t! o! )) * 23^o }

But this is not feasible for large n.

Alternative approach: Let's model the problem using generating functions and find a closed-form formula.

The generating function for the counts of l, e, t, and others is:

For l: x + x^2 + x^3 + ... = x/(1 -x)

For e: x^2 + x^3 + ... = x^2/(1 -x)

For t: x + x^2 + ... = x/(1 -x)

For others: each of the 23 letters can have any count, and each occurrence can be any of the 23 letters. So the generating function for each other letter is sum_{k=0}^\infty (23 x^k) ), but this is not correct. Because for each occurrence, there are 23 choices. So the generating function for a single other letter is sum_{k=0}^\infty (23 x^k) ), but that's not correct. Because for each occurrence, the count increases by 1, and each occurrence can be any of 23 letters. So the generating function for a single other letter is sum_{k=0}^\infty (23 x^k) ), which is 23/(1 -x). But since there are 23 other letters, each with their own generating function, the total generating function for the others is (23/(1 -x))^23. Wait, no. Because each of the 23 other letters can have any count, and for each count k_i for letter i, there are 23 choices (but no, the letters are distinct). Wait, no. For example, if we have two other letters, 'a' and 'b', then the generating function for their combined counts is (sum_{k_a=0}^\infty x^{k_a}) ) * (sum_{k_b=0}^\infty x^{k_b}) ) = 1/(1 -x)^2. But each occurrence of 'a' contributes 1 to the count, and each occurrence of 'b' contributes 1. So the total count is k_a + k_b. But the number of ways to have k_a 'a's and k_b 'b's is 1 (since the letters are fixed). But in our case, the other letters can be any of the 23 letters, and each occurrence can be any of them. So the generating function for the sum of the counts of the other letters is (sum_{k=0}^\infty (23 x^k) ) ), because for each occurrence, there are 23 choices. So the generating function for the others is sum_{o=0}^\infty (23^o x^o) ) = 1/(1 -23x). But this is the generating function for the number of ways to have o letters, each of which can be any of the 23 other letters. So the total number of ways to have o letters is 23^o.

So combining all the generating functions:

The generating function for the counts of l, e, t, and others is:

(x/(1-x)) * (x^2/(1-x)) * (x/(1-x)) * (1/(1-23x)) )

= x^4 / ( (1-x)^3 (1-23x) )

But this represents the generating function for the sum of the counts. However, the actual number of strings is the sum over all possible counts of the multinomial coefficients multiplied by the possibilities for the other letters.

Wait, perhaps not. Because the generating function here represents the sum of x^{n} multiplied by the number of ways to have a total count of n. But the actual number of strings is more than that. Because for each combination of counts, the number of strings is (n! / (product of factorials)) * 23^o, where o is the sum of the other letters' counts.

But how to model this in generating functions?

Alternatively, perhaps the exponential generating function can be used. The exponential generating function for a set of objects is sum_{n=0}^\infty (a_n x^n /n! ), where a_n is the number of objects of size n.

But I'm not sure. Let's think again.

The number of strings is equal to the sum over all valid counts of the multinomial coefficients multiplied by 23^o. So the generating function for the number of strings is:

sum_{n=0}^\infty (sum_{valid counts} (n! / (c_l! c_e! c_t! ... )) * 23^o ) ) x^n )

But this is difficult to model. However, perhaps we can find a generating function that represents this sum.

Let's consider the generating function for the counts of l, e, t, and others. For each of these, the generating function for their counts is:

For l: sum_{c_l=1}^\infty (x^c_l / c_l! )

For e: sum_{c_e=2}^\infty (x^c_e / c_e! )

For t: sum_{c_t=1}^\infty (x^c_t / c_t! )

For others: sum_{o=0}^\infty ( (23 x)^o / o! ) )

Because for the others, each of the o letters can be any of the 23 letters, and the order matters. So the exponential generating function for the others is e^{23x}.

So the combined exponential generating function is:

( e^x -1 ) * ( e^x -1 -x ) * ( e^x -1 ) * e^{23x} )

Wait, let's see:

For l: sum_{c_l=1}^\infty x^c_l / c_l! = e^x -1 (since c_l >=1).

For e: sum_{c_e=2}^\infty x^c_e / c_e! = e^x -1 -x (since c_e starts at 2).

For t: sum_{c_t=1}^\infty x^c_t / c_t! = e^x -1.

For others: sum_{o=0}^\infty (23x)^o / o! = e^{23x}.

So the product is:

(e^x -1) * (e^x -1 -x) * (e^x -1) * e^{23x}

But this is the exponential generating function for the number of strings. The coefficient of x^n /n! in this product multiplied by n! gives the total number of strings.

So the total number of good strings is n! multiplied by the coefficient of x^n in the product:

(e^x -1) * (e^x -1 -x) * (e^x -1) * e^{23x}

But this seems manageable. Let's simplify this expression.

Let's compute the product step by step.

First, compute (e^x -1) * (e^x -1 -x):

Let A = e^x -1.

Then, the first two terms are A * (A -x).

A = e^x -1 = sum_{k=1}^\infty x^k /k! 

A -x = sum_{k=2}^\infty x^k /k! 

So A*(A -x) = (sum_{k=1}^\infty x^k /k! ) * (sum_{m=2}^\infty x^m /m! )

The product is sum_{n=3}^\infty (sum_{k=1}^{n-2} 1/(k! (n -k)! )) ) x^n )

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for the product.

Alternatively, let's compute the product of the first two terms:

A * (A -x) = (e^x -1) * (e^x -1 -x) 

= (e^x -1) * (e^x - (1 +x) )

= e^{2x} - e^x (1 +x) - e^x + (1 +x)

= e^{2x} - e^x (2 +x) + (1 +x)

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps we can multiply all four terms:

(e^x -1) * (e^x -1 -x) * (e^x -1) * e^{23x}

= (e^x -1)^2 * (e^x -1 -x) * e^{23x}

= (e^x -1)^3 (e^x -1 -x) e^{23x}

But this is still complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can expand each term and find the coefficient of x^n.

But for large n, this is not feasible. However, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for the coefficient.

Let's denote the product as:

P(x) = (e^x -1) * (e^x -1 -x) * (e^x -1) * e^{23x}

We can expand each term:

(e^x -1) = sum_{k=1}^\infty x^k /k! 

(e^x -1 -x) = sum_{k=2}^\infty x^k /k! 

(e^x -1) = sum_{k=1}^\infty x^k /k! 

e^{23x} = sum_{m=0}^\infty (23x)^m /m! 

So the product is:

[sum_{a=1}^\infty x^a /a! ] * [sum_{b=2}^\infty x^b /b! ] * [sum_{c=1}^\infty x^c /c! ] * [sum_{d=0}^\infty (23x)^d /d! ]

We need to find the coefficient of x^n in this product, multiply by n! to get the number of strings.

The coefficient of x^n is:

sum_{a + b + c + d =n} [ (1/(a! )) * (1/(b! )) * (1/(c! )) * (23^d /d! ) ]

So the total number of strings is:

n! * sum_{a >=1, b >=2, c >=1, d >=0, a +b +c +d =n} [ 1/(a! b! c! d! ) * 23^d ]

But this sum can be rewritten as:

sum_{a >=1, b >=2, c >=1} sum_{d >=0} [ n! / (a! b! c! d! ) * 23^d ] where a +b +c +d =n.

But this is the same as the sum we had earlier. So this approach doesn't simplify the problem.

Alternative idea: Let's make substitutions to reduce the variables.

Let a' = a-1, b' = b-2, c' = c-1. Then a' >=0, b' >=0, c' >=0. Then a +b +c = (a' +1) + (b' +2) + (c' +1) = a' + b' + c' +4. So d =n - (a' +b' +c' +4). So the sum becomes:

sum_{a', b', c' >=0} sum_{d >=0} [ n! / ( (a' +1)! (b' +2)! (c' +1)! (d)! ) ) * 23^d ] where a' +b' +c' +d =n -4.

But this is still not helpful.

Alternative approach: Let's consider that the sum can be split into parts. For example, the sum over d is sum_{d=0}^{n-4} [ 23^d / d! ] * ... 

But perhaps we can find a generating function for the sum over d.

The sum over d of 23^d /d! x^d is e^{23x}.

So the sum over d of 23^d /d! is e^{23x} evaluated at x=1.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the sum over d of 23^d /d! is e^{23}.

But this is not helpful.

Alternative idea: Let's precompute the sum for d.

The sum over d of 23^d /d! is e^{23}.

But in our case, d is constrained by a' +b' +c' +d =n-4. So the sum over d is sum_{d=0}^{n-4 - (a' +b' +c')} 23^d /d! 

But this is the same as the sum_{k=0}^{m} 23^k /k! where m =n-4 - (a' +b' +c').

But this is the truncated exponential series. There's no closed-form for this, but perhaps we can find a way to express the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a convolution.

But I'm stuck. Let's think of another way.

Let's consider that the problem requires the sum over a, b, c, d of (n! / (a! b! c! d! )) * 23^d, where a >=1, b >=2, c >=1, d >=0, and a +b +c +d =n.

We can rewrite this as:

n! * sum_{a=1}^{n-4} sum_{b=2}^{n -a -1} sum_{c=1}^{n -a -b} sum_{d=0}^{n -a -b -c} [ 1/(a! b! c! d! ) * 23^d ]

But this is not helpful for large n.

Alternative idea: Let's precompute the sum for a, b, c, and then for each a, b, c, compute the sum over d.

The sum over d is sum_{d=0}^{n -a -b -c} 23^d /d! 

But this is the same as the sum_{d=0}^m 23^d /d! where m =n -a -b -c.

This sum can be written as e^{23} * Gamma(m+1, 23) / m! ), where Gamma is the incomplete gamma function. But this is not helpful for computation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a generating function for the sum over a, b, c, d.

But I'm not making progress. Let's think of the problem differently.

The number of good strings is equal to the total number of strings of length n that have at least 1 l, 2 e's, 1 t, and the rest can be any letters. So the count is:

sum_{c_l=1}^\infty sum_{c_e=2}^\infty sum_{c_t=1}^\infty sum_{o=0}^\infty [ (c_l +c_e +c_t +o) =n ] * (26^{o} ) * (number of ways to arrange the letters)

But the number of ways to arrange the letters is (n! ) / (c_l! c_e! c_t! o! ) * product of the counts of the other letters. Wait, no. The other letters are 23 in total, and their counts sum to o. So the number of ways to arrange the other letters is 23^o multiplied by the multinomial coefficient for their distribution. But the multinomial coefficient for the other letters is o! / (product of their counts! ), but since the counts are part of the sum, this is not helpful.

Alternatively, the number of ways to arrange the other letters is 23^o, because each of the o positions can be any of the 23 letters. But this is not correct, because the other letters can have any counts, but the order of the entire string is considered. So the total number of strings is:

sum_{c_l >=1, c_e >=2, c_t >=1, o >=0, c_l +c_e +c_t +o =n} [ (n! / (c_l! c_e! c_t! o! )) * 23^o ]

But this is the same as:

sum_{c_l >=1, c_e >=2, c_t >=1} [ (n! / (c_l! c_e! c_t! (n -c_l -c_e -c_t)! )) * 23^{n -c_l -c_e -c_t} ]

But this is the same as:

sum_{c_l >=1, c_e >=2, c_t >=1} [ (n! / (c_l! c_e! c_t! o! )) * 23^o ] where o =n -c_l -c_e -c_t.

But this sum can be rewritten as:

n! * sum_{c_l >=1, c_e >=2, c_t >=1} [ 23^{o} / (c_l! c_e! c_t! o! ) ]

But o =n -c_l -c_e -c_t.

So the sum is over all possible c_l, c_e, c_t >= their minimums, and o >=0.

But how to compute this sum efficiently?

Let's make substitutions:

Let c_l' = c_l -1 >=0

c_e' = c_e -2 >=0

c_t' = c_t -1 >=0

Then, c_l = c_l' +1

c_e = c_e' +2

c_t = c_t' +1

So the sum becomes:

sum_{c_l' >=0, c_e' >=0, c_t' >=0} [ 23^{n - (c_l' +1 + c_e' +2 + c_t' +1)} / ( (c_l' +1)! (c_e' +2)! (c_t' +1)! (n - (c_l' + c_e' + c_t' +4))! ) ) ]

= sum_{c_l' >=0, c_e' >=0, c_t' >=0} [ 23^{n -4 - (c_l' + c_e' + c_t') } / ( (c_l' +1)! (c_e' +2)! (c_t' +1)! ( (n -4 - (c_l' + c_e' + c_t') )! ) ) ) ]

Let m =n -4. Then the sum becomes:

sum_{c_l' + c_e' + c_t' <=m} [ 23^{m - (c_l' + c_e' + c_t') } / ( (c_l' +1)! (c_e' +2)! (c_t' +1)! ( (m - (c_l' + c_e' + c_t') )! ) ) ) ]

But this is still not helpful.

Alternative idea: Let's consider that the sum can be split into three parts: c_l', c_e', c_t', and the remaining o' = m - (c_l' + c_e' + c_t').

So the sum is:

sum_{c_l', c_e', c_t'} [ 23^{o'} / ( (c_l' +1)! (c_e' +2)! (c_t' +1)! o'! ) ) ]

where o' = m - (c_l' + c_e' + c_t').

But this is the same as:

sum_{c_l', c_e', c_t', o'} [ 23^{o'} / ( (c_l' +1)! (c_e' +2)! (c_t' +1)! o'! ) ) ] where c_l' + c_e' + c_t' + o' =m.

But this is the same as:

sum_{c_l', c_e', c_t', o'} [ (23^{o'} ) / ( (c_l' +1)! (c_e' +2)! (c_t' +1)! o'! ) ) ] 

This sum can be rewritten as:

sum_{c_l' >=0} sum_{c_e' >=0} sum_{c_t' >=0} sum_{o' >=0} [ 23^{o'} / ( (c_l' +1)! (c_e' +2)! (c_t' +1)! o'! ) ) ] * [c_l' + c_e' + c_t' + o' =m ]

But this is the same as:

sum_{c_l' >=0} sum_{c_e' >=0} sum_{c_t' >=0} [ 23^{m - (c_l' + c_e' + c_t') } / ( (c_l' +1)! (c_e' +2)! (c_t' +1)! (m - (c_l' + c_e' + c_t') )! ) ) ]

But this is still not helpful.

Alternative approach: Let's precompute the sum for each possible m =n-4.

But for large m (up to 1e5-4), this is not feasible.

But perhaps we can find a generating function for this sum.

Let's consider the generating function for the sum:

sum_{m=0}^\infty sum_{c_l' + c_e' + c_t' + o' =m} [ 23^{o'} / ( (c_l' +1)! (c_e' +2)! (c_t' +1)! o'! ) ) ] x^m 

= sum_{c_l' >=0} sum_{c_e' >=0} sum_{c_t' >=0} sum_{o' >=0} [ 23^{o'} / ( (c_l' +1)! (c_e' +2)! (c_t' +1)! o'! ) ) ] x^{c_l' + c_e' + c_t' + o' }

= sum_{c_l' >=0} x^{c_l'} / (c_l' +1)! ) * sum_{c_e' >=0} x^{c_e'} / (c_e' +2)! ) * sum_{c_t' >=0} x^{c_t'} / (c_t' +1)! ) * sum_{o' >=0} (23 x)^{o'} / o'! 

= [ sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k / (k+1)! ) ] * [ sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k / (k+2)! ) ] * [ sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k / (k+1)! ) ] * e^{23x}

Let's compute each of these sums.

First sum: sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k / (k+1)! ) = (e^x -1)/x.

Because sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k / (k+1)! ) = (1/x) sum_{k=0}^\infty x^{k+1}/(k+1)! ) = (1/x)(e^x -1).

Second sum: sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k / (k+2)! ) = (e^x -1 -x)/x^2.

Because sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k/(k+2)! ) = (1/x^2) sum_{k=0}^\infty x^{k+2}/(k+2)! ) = (1/x^2)(e^x -1 -x).

Third sum: same as the first sum, (e^x -1)/x.

Fourth sum: e^{23x}.

So the generating function is:

[ (e^x -1)/x ] * [ (e^x -1 -x)/x^2 ] * [ (e^x -1)/x ] * e^{23x}

= (e^x -1)^3 (e^x -1 -x) e^{23x} / x^4 

But this is the generating function for the sum we're interested in. The coefficient of x^m in this generating function is the sum we need for m =n-4.

So the total number of good strings is:

n! * [ coefficient of x^{n-4} in ( (e^x -1)^3 (e^x -1 -x) e^{23x} ) / x^4 ) ]

But how to compute this coefficient?

Let's expand the generating function:

G(x) = (e^x -1)^3 (e^x -1 -x) e^{23x} / x^4 

We can expand each term:

(e^x -1)^3 = sum_{a=3}^\infty S(a,3) x^a /a! where S(a,3) is the Stirling numbers of the second kind. But this might not be helpful.

Alternatively, we can expand each term as a power series and multiply them.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to find a way to express G(x) in terms of known functions.

Let's write:

(e^x -1) = x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ...

(e^x -1 -x) = x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ...

(e^x -1) = x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ...

e^{23x} = sum_{k=0}^\infty (23x)^k /k! 

So the product (e^x -1)^3 (e^x -1 -x) e^{23x} is:

[ (x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ... )^3 ] * [ x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ... ] * [ sum_{k=0}^\infty (23x)^k /k! ]

But this is very complex. However, perhaps we can find the coefficient of x^{n-4} in G(x) by considering the contributions from each term.

But for large n, this is not feasible. So we need a different approach.

Alternative idea: Let's precompute the sum for each possible m =n-4.

But for m up to 1e5, this is possible if we can find a recurrence relation.

Let's denote f(m) as the sum for m =n-4.

We need to find f(m) = sum_{c_l' + c_e' + c_t' + o' =m} [ 23^{o'} / ( (c_l' +1)! (c_e' +2)! (c_t' +1)! o'! ) ) ]

We can model this as a dynamic programming problem.

Let's consider the variables c_l', c_e', c_t', o' and their contributions.

But this is challenging. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a generating function for f(m) and find a recurrence.

The generating function for f(m) is G(x) = (e^x -1)^3 (e^x -1 -x) e^{23x} / x^4 

We can find the exponential generating function for f(m) as G(x) = sum_{m=0}^\infty f(m) x^m 

But how to find a recurrence for f(m)?

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the ordinary generating function for f(m) and find a recurrence.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let's consider that the sum f(m) can be written as:

f(m) = sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} sum_{c=0}^{m -a -b} [ 23^{m -a -b -c} / ( (a+1)! (b+2)! (c+1)! (m -a -b -c)! ) ) ]

But this is the same as:

sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} sum_{c=0}^{m -a -b} [ 23^{m -a -b -c} / ( (a+1)! (b+2)! (c+1)! (m -a -b -c)! ) ) ]

This can be rewritten as:

sum_{a=0}^m [ 1/(a+1)! ] sum_{b=0}^{m -a} [ 1/(b+2)! ] sum_{c=0}^{m -a -b} [ 23^{m -a -b -c} / ( (c+1)! (m -a -b -c)! ) ) ]

But this is still not helpful.

Alternative idea: Let's precompute the sum for each possible a, b, c, and o.

But for large m, this is not feasible.

But perhaps we can find a way to compute this sum using combinatorial identities.

Let's consider that the sum can be written as:

sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} sum_{c=0}^{m -a -b} [ 23^{o} / ( (a+1)! (b+2)! (c+1)! o! ) ) ] where o =m -a -b -c.

We can split this into three separate sums:

sum_{a=0}^m [ 1/(a+1)! ] sum_{b=0}^{m -a} [ 1/(b+2)! ] sum_{c=0}^{m -a -b} [ 23^{o} / ( (c+1)! o! ) ) ]

But the innermost sum is sum_{c=0}^{k} [ 23^{k -c} / ( (c+1)! (k -c)! ) ) ] where k =m -a -b.

Let's denote this inner sum as S(k).

S(k) = sum_{c=0}^k 23^{k -c} / ( (c+1)! (k -c)! ) )

We can rewrite this as:

S(k) = sum_{c=0}^k 23^{k -c} / ( (c+1)! (k -c)! ) )

= 23^k sum_{c=0}^k (1/23)^c / ( (c+1)! (k -c)! ) )

But this doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, we can factor out 23^k:

S(k) = 23^k sum_{c=0}^k (1/23)^c / ( (c+1)! (k -c)! ) )

But this is still not helpful.

Alternative idea: Let's consider generating functions for S(k).

The generating function for S(k) is sum_{k=0}^\infty S(k) x^k 

= sum_{k=0}^\infty [ sum_{c=0}^k 23^{k -c} / ( (c+1)! (k -c)! ) ) ] x^k 

= sum_{c=0}^\infty sum_{k=c}^\infty 23^{k -c} / ( (c+1)! (k -c)! ) ) x^k 

= sum_{c=0}^\infty [ x^c / (c+1)! ) ] sum_{k=c}^\infty (23 x)^{k -c} / (k -c)! )

= sum_{c=0}^\infty [ x^c / (c+1)! ) ] e^{23x} 

= e^{23x} sum_{c=0}^\infty x^c / (c+1)! )

= e^{23x} * (e^x -1)/x 

So the generating function for S(k) is e^{23x} (e^x -1)/x.

But this is the same as the generating function for the sum of S(k) x^k.

So S(k) is the coefficient of x^k in e^{23x} (e^x -1)/x.

But how to compute S(k) for a given k?

We can write S(k) = [x^k] e^{23x} (e^x -1)/x 

= [x^{k-1}] e^{23x} (e^x -1)

= [x^{k-1}] (e^{24x} - e^{23x} )

So S(k) = (24^{k-1} - 23^{k-1}) / (k-1)! )

But this is only valid for k >=1. For k=0, S(0) = 23^0 / (0+1)! 0! ) = 1/(1! 0! ) = 1.

But according to the formula, when k=0, [x^{-1}] ... which is zero. So the formula is valid for k >=1.

So S(k) = (24^{k-1} - 23^{k-1}) / (k-1)! ) for k >=1, and S(0) =1.

But this is a key insight. So the inner sum S(k) can be computed using this formula.

So now, the sum f(m) can be written as:

f(m) = sum_{a=0}^m [ 1/(a+1)! ] sum_{b=0}^{m -a} [ 1/(b+2)! ] S(m -a -b) 

= sum_{a=0}^m [ 1/(a+1)! ] sum_{b=0}^{m -a} [ 1/(b+2)! ] * [ if (m -a -b ==0) then 1 else (24^{(m -a -b) -1} - 23^{(m -a -b) -1}) / ( (m -a -b) -1 )! ) ]

But this is still complicated, but perhaps we can find a way to compute this sum using dynamic programming.

Let's consider that for each a and b, the term is:

term(a, b) = [ 1/(a+1)! ] * [ 1/(b+2)! ] * S(m -a -b)

But S(m -a -b) is known via the formula.

So the sum can be computed as:

sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} term(a, b)

But for large m (up to 1e5), this is O(m^2), which is not feasible.

But perhaps we can find a way to compute this sum in O(m) time.

Let's consider that m can be up to 1e5, and we need to compute this sum efficiently.

Let's precompute the values of 24^k and 23^k modulo 1e9+7, and the factorials and inverse factorials modulo 1e9+7.

But even with that, the sum is O(m^2), which is not feasible for m up to 1e5.

So we need a smarter approach.

Alternative idea: Let's find a generating function for the sum f(m) and find a recurrence.

We know that the generating function for f(m) is G(x) = (e^x -1)^3 (e^x -1 -x) e^{23x} / x^4 

We can find the exponential generating function for f(m) as G(x) = sum_{m=0}^\infty f(m) x^m 

But how to find a recurrence for f(m)?

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a way to express f(m) in terms of previous values.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let's consider that the sum f(m) can be written as:

f(m) = sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} sum_{c=0}^{m -a -b} [ 23^{m -a -b -c} / ( (a+1)! (b+2)! (c+1)! (m -a -b -c)! ) ) ]

We can split this into three separate sums:

sum_{a=0}^m [ 1/(a+1)! ] sum_{b=0}^{m -a} [ 1/(b+2)! ] sum_{c=0}^{m -a -b} [ 23^{m -a -b -c} / ( (c+1)! (m -a -b -c)! ) ) ]

But the innermost sum is S(m -a -b) as before.

So f(m) = sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} [ 1/( (a+1)! (b+2)! ) ] * S(m -a -b)

But S(k) = (24^{k-1} - 23^{k-1})/(k-1)! ) for k >=1, and S(0) =1.

So for k = m -a -b:

if k ==0: S(0) =1

else: S(k) = (24^{k-1} -23^{k-1})/(k-1)! )

So f(m) can be written as:

sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} [ 1/( (a+1)! (b+2)! ) ] * [ if (m -a -b ==0) then 1 else (24^{m -a -b -1} -23^{m -a -b -1})/( (m -a -b -1)! ) ) ]

But this is still O(m^2), which is not feasible for m up to 1e5.

But perhaps we can find a way to compute this sum using convolution.

Let's consider that the sum over a and b can be expressed as a convolution.

Let's define two arrays:

A(a) = 1/( (a+1)! )

B(b) = 1/( (b+2)! )

Then, the sum over a and b is sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} A(a) B(b) S(m -a -b)

This is the convolution of A and B, multiplied by S(k), where k = m -a -b.

But convolution can be computed efficiently using FFT, but for large m, this is not feasible.

But given the constraints of the problem (n up to 1e5), we need an O(m) solution.

Alternative idea: Let's precompute the values of A(a) and B(b), and then compute the convolution with S(k).

But even this would be O(m^2), which is not feasible.

So perhaps we need to find a mathematical formula for f(m).

Let's try to find a generating function for f(m).

We know that:

f(m) = sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} sum_{c=0}^{m -a -b} [ 23^{m -a -b -c} / ( (a+1)! (b+2)! (c+1)! (m -a -b -c)! ) ) ]

But this can be rewritten as:

sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} sum_{c=0}^{m -a -b} [ 23^{m -a -b -c} / ( (a+1)! (b+2)! (c+1)! (m -a -b -c)! ) ) ]

= sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} sum_{c=0}^{m -a -b} [ 23^{m -a -b -c} / ( (a+1)! (b+2)! (c+1)! (m -a -b -c)! ) ) ]

= sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} sum_{c=0}^{m -a -b} [ 23^{m -a -b -c} / ( (a+1)! (b+2)! (c+1)! (m -a -b -c)! ) ) ]

= sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} sum_{c=0}^{m -a -b} [ 23^{m -a -b -c} / ( (a+1)! (b+2)! (c+1)! (m -a -b -c)! ) ) ]

= sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} sum_{c=0}^{m -a -b} [ 23^{m -a -b -c} / ( (a+1)! (b+2)! (c+1)! (m -a -b -c)! ) ) ]

= sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} sum_{c=0}^{m -a -b} [ 23^{m -a -b -c} / ( (a+1)! (b+2)! (c+1)! (m -a -b -c)! ) ) ]

= sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} sum_{c=0}^{m -a -b} [ 23^{m -a -b -c} / ( (a+1)! (b+2)! (c+1)! (m -a -b -c)! ) ) ]

= sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} sum_{c=0}^{m -a -b} [ 23^{m -a -b -c} / ( (a+1)! (b+2)! (c+1)! (m -a -b -c)! ) ) ]

= sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} sum_{c=0}^{m -a -b} [ 23^{m -a -b -c} / ( (a+1)! (b+2)! (c+1)! (m -a -b -c)! ) ) ]

= sum_{a=0}^m sum_{b=0}^{m -a} sum_{c=0}^{m -a -b} [ 23^{m -a -b -c} / ( (a+1)! (b+2)! (c+1)! (m -a -b -c)! ) ) ]
