Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where after performing some operations on the array, I have to select k elements such that their squares sum to the maximum possible value. The operations allowed are choosing two distinct indices i and j, then updating nums[i] to (nums[i] AND nums[j]) and nums[j] to (nums[i] OR nums[j]). Hmm, interesting.

First, I need to understand what these operations do. Let's think about the AND and OR operations. When you perform the operation on i and j, the new values are (a AND b) and (a OR b), where a and b are the original values. Wait, but since the order of i and j doesn't matter here. Because if you swap i and j, the result would be the same. Because (a AND b) is the same as (b AND a), and (a OR b) is the same as (b OR a). So the operation is commutative in that sense.

But what's the effect of multiple operations? Let's take an example. Suppose we have two numbers, a and b. After one operation, they become (a & b) and (a | b). Let's compute a & b and a | b. The sum of these two is (a & b) + (a | b) = a + b. Because (a | b) = a + b - (a & b). So when you add them, the (a & b) terms cancel out, and you get a + b. So the sum of the two elements remains the same after each operation. Wait, that's a key insight. Because each operation replaces the two elements with two others whose sum is the same as the original sum. So the sum of all elements in the array is preserved through any number of operations. Because each operation just swaps the sum between the two elements but keeps the total sum the same. So the total sum of the array is a constant, regardless of the operations performed. That's important.

But how does this affect the individual elements? Let's think. For example, if we have two elements, after the operation, their sum is the same. But their individual values change. For example, if a=2 (10 in binary) and b=8 (1000), then a&b is 0, a|b is 10 (1010?), wait 2 OR 8 is 10 (binary 1010 is 10 in decimal). So after the operation, the two elements are 0 and 10. Their sum is 10, which is 2+8. So the sum remains the same.

So the sum of the entire array is fixed. So when we select k elements, the sum of their squares is to be maximized. But how can we maximize the sum of squares given that the sum of all elements is fixed? Because the sum of squares is maximized when the elements are as unequal as possible. For example, if you have a fixed sum S, the sum of squares is maximized when one element is S and the others are 0. Because (S)^2 + 0 + ... is S², which is larger than any other distribution. So the problem reduces to selecting the k elements in such a way that as many as possible of them are as large as possible, given the constraints of the operations.

But wait, the operations can't create new bits. Because when you perform the AND and OR operations, the bits in the numbers can only stay the same or decrease. Let me think. For example, if a number has a bit set, can that bit ever be unset through these operations?

Wait, let's take two numbers. Suppose a has a bit set at position x, and b does not. Then, when you perform the operation, the new a becomes a & b, which would have that bit unset. The new b becomes a | b, which would have that bit set. So in this case, the bit is moved from a to b. So the total number of set bits in the entire array remains the same. Because the bit is just moved from one element to another. So the total number of set bits in the array is preserved through any number of operations. Because each operation moves bits between elements but doesn't add or remove them. So the total count of set bits is a fixed value. Let's call this total_bits.

So the problem now becomes: given that the total number of set bits in the array is fixed, how can we arrange those bits into k elements such that the sum of their squares is maximized. Because the sum of squares is maximized when the elements are as large as possible. So the optimal strategy is to have as many high bits as possible concentrated into as few elements as possible.

For example, if we have total_bits = 5, and k=2, then the best is to have one element with all 5 bits set (if possible) and the other with 0. But how does that work with the bits? Because each bit can only be in one element. So the sum of squares would be (2^m -1)^2 + 0, where m is the number of bits. Wait, but bits can be in different positions. So the maximum possible value for a single element is the sum of all the bits in their respective positions. For example, if the total bits are 3, and they are in positions 0, 1, and 2, then the maximum possible value is 7 (111 in binary). So the sum of squares would be 7² + 0 + ... for the other elements.

So the problem reduces to: given the total number of set bits (total_bits) in the array, how to distribute them into k elements such that the sum of squares is maximized. The sum of squares is maximized when the bits are as concentrated as possible into the largest possible numbers.

So the optimal way is to have as many bits as possible in the largest possible numbers. For example, if we have total_bits bits, the maximum sum of squares is achieved by having the first element have as many bits as possible, then the next, etc., until we have k elements. But how?

Let me think. Let's say we have total_bits bits. We need to distribute them into k elements. Each element can have any number of bits, but the sum of all bits across elements is total_bits. The sum of squares is the sum of (sum of 2^b for each bit b in the element) squared. Wait, no. Each element's value is the sum of 2^b for each bit b that is set in it. So the square of that is (sum 2^b)^2. But how to maximize the sum of these squares.

But perhaps the optimal way is to have the bits concentrated into as few elements as possible. For example, if you have 5 bits and k=2, then the best is to have one element with all 5 bits (if possible) and the other with 0. But how can that be possible? Because each bit can only be in one element. So the sum of squares would be (sum of all 2^b for each bit) squared plus 0. But if the bits are spread across multiple elements, the sum of squares would be lower.

Wait, but the sum of squares is maximized when the terms are as large as possible. For example, (a^2 + b^2) is maximized when a is as large as possible and b as small as possible, given a + b is fixed. So in this case, the sum of squares is maximized when the elements are as unequal as possible.

So the problem reduces to: given total_bits, distribute them into k elements such that the sum of squares is maximized. The way to do this is to have as many bits as possible in the largest possible element, then the next, etc.

But how to model this. Let's think of the bits as being in different positions. For example, if the bits are in positions 0, 1, 2, etc. Then, the maximum possible value for a single element is the sum of all the bits in the highest possible positions. Wait, but the bits can be in any positions. So the maximum possible value for a single element is the sum of all the bits in the array. Because if all the bits are in that element, then its value is the sum of 2^b for each bit b. But how can that be possible? Because the bits are spread across the array. Wait, but the operations allow us to move bits between elements. For example, if two elements have bits in different positions, we can perform operations to combine them into one element. Let's see.

Suppose we have two elements, a and b. a has a bit in position x, and b has a bit in position y. Then, if we perform the operation on them, the new a is a & b (which is 0, since the bits are in different positions), and the new b is a | b (which has both bits). So after the operation, the bit from a is moved to b. So in this way, we can collect all the bits into a single element. So the total_bits is the sum of all the bits in the array, and through operations, we can collect all of them into a single element. Then, the sum of squares would be (sum of all 2^b)^2 plus zeros for the other elements. But if k is larger than 1, then we can have one element with all the bits, and the rest as zero. But wait, the problem allows us to choose any k elements. So if k is 2, then the maximum sum is (sum of all bits)^2 + 0. But if k is larger than the number of elements that can have bits, then the rest would be zero.

Wait, but the problem says that after any number of operations, we can arrange the bits in any way, as long as the total number of set bits is the same. So the key is that the total_bits is fixed, and the sum of squares is maximized when the bits are as concentrated as possible into the k elements.

So the problem reduces to: given total_bits, how to select k elements such that the sum of their squares is maximized, given that the sum of all bits is total_bits. But how?

Wait, but each element's value is the sum of 2^b for each bit b that is set in it. So the square of that is (sum 2^b)^2. But how to maximize the sum of these squares. Let's think of each bit as a separate entity. Each bit can be in one element. The contribution of a bit in position b to the sum of squares is (2^b)^2 if it's in an element that is selected. But if multiple bits are in the same element, their contributions are (sum 2^b)^2, which is the sum of all their individual squares plus twice the sum of their pairwise products. So, for example, if two bits are in the same element, their contribution is (2^a + 2^b)^2 = 2^{2a} + 2^{2b} + 2^{a+b+1}. Which is larger than if they were in separate elements (2^{2a} + 2^{2b}).

So, the sum of squares is maximized when as many bits as possible are grouped into the same elements. Because the cross terms (like 2^{a+b+1}) add to the sum. So the optimal way is to have as many bits as possible in the same elements. But how to model this.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum sum of squares is achieved by selecting the k elements with the highest possible individual values, given that the total_bits is fixed. But how to compute that.

Wait, but the total_bits is fixed. So the sum of all the bits in the array is fixed. So the problem is to select k elements, each of which can have any number of bits (but the sum of all bits across all elements is total_bits), such that the sum of their squares is maximized.

But how to model this. Let's think of the bits as being in different positions. For example, each bit is in a unique position. Then, the maximum sum of squares would be achieved by selecting the k elements with the highest possible values, which would be the elements that have the highest bits. For example, if the bits are in positions 30, 20, 10, 5, 0, and k=3, then the optimal selection is the elements with bits 30, 20, 10. Their squares would be (2^30)^2 + (2^20)^2 + (2^10)^2. But if we can combine some bits into the same element, like putting 30 and 20 into the same element, then the square would be (2^30 + 2^20)^2 = 2^60 + 2^40 + 2^30, which is larger than 2^60 + 2^40. So combining bits into the same element increases the sum of squares.

So the optimal approach is to group as many bits as possible into the same elements, starting with the highest bits. Because each time you add a bit to an element, the square increases by (current sum + new bit)^2 - (current sum)^2 = 2*current sum * new bit + (new bit)^2. Since the new bit is a power of two, this is positive. So adding a bit to an element increases the sum of squares.

Therefore, the maximum sum of squares is achieved by combining all the bits into as few elements as possible, up to k elements. So the strategy is:

1. Count the total number of set bits (total_bits) in the array. Because the operations can't change this number.

2. Then, the problem reduces to selecting k elements, each of which can have any number of bits (but the sum of all bits is total_bits), such that the sum of their squares is maximized.

But how to model this. Let's think of the bits as being in different positions. For example, each bit is in a unique position. Then, the maximum sum of squares is achieved by combining as many bits as possible into the same elements. So the optimal way is to have the first element contain the highest possible bits, then the next, etc., until we have k elements.

But how to compute this. Let's think of the bits as a list sorted in descending order of their positions. For example, the highest bit is first, then the next, etc. Then, the maximum sum of squares is the sum of the squares of the first m elements, where m is the minimum between the number of bits and k. Wait, no. Because if you have more bits than k, you can group them into k elements. For example, if you have 5 bits and k=2, you can group the first 4 bits into the first element and the fifth into the second. Or the first 3 and the next 2. But which grouping gives a higher sum of squares?

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose the bits are in positions 3, 2, 1, 0, and k=2. The total_bits is 5. How to split them into two elements to maximize the sum of squares.

Option 1: group the first 4 bits into one element (sum 8 +4 +2 +1 =15) and the fifth (bit 0) into another (1). Sum of squares: 15² +1²=225+1=226.

Option 2: group the first 3 bits (8+4+2=14) and the next two (1+0.5? Wait, no. The bits are in positions 3,2,1,0. So the sum of the first three is 8+4+2=14, and the next two are 1. So sum of squares 14² +1²=196+1=197. Which is less than 226.

Option 3: group the first two bits (8+4=12) and the next three (2+1+0.5? No, the bits are 2,1,0. So sum is 2+1+0.5? Wait, no. The bits are in positions 3,2,1,0. So the sum of the first two is 8+4=12, and the next three are 2+1+0.5? No, the positions are 3,2,1,0. So the sum of the next three is 2 (position 1) +1 (position 0) + ... Wait, no. The bits are in positions 3,2,1,0. So the sum of the first two is 8+4=12. The sum of the next three is 2 (position 1) +1 (position 0) + ... but there are only four bits. So the third and fourth bits are 2 and 1. So sum of the next three would be 2+1+ ... but there are only two bits left. So perhaps the example is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the example is not the best. Let's take another example. Suppose the bits are in positions 3,2,1,0, and k=2. So total_bits=5? No, each bit is a separate set. So the total_bits is 5? No, each bit is a separate set. So the array has 5 elements, each with a single bit. Then, the total_bits is 5. So when we perform operations, we can combine them into two elements. For example, combine the first four into one element (sum 8+4+2+1=15) and the fifth (bit 0) into another (1). Sum of squares 15² +1²=226. Alternatively, combine the first three into 14, and the next two into 3 (2+1). Sum of squares 14² +3²=196+9=205. Which is less than 226. So the first option is better.

So the best way is to combine as many bits as possible into the first element, then the next as many as possible into the second, etc. So the optimal approach is to group the highest bits into the first element, then the next highest into the second, and so on, until we have k elements. If there are more bits than k, then each element after the first k-1 will take one bit each, but that's not possible. Wait, no. Let's think again.

The total_bits is the sum of all the bits in the array. But each bit is a separate set. So when we perform operations, we can combine any number of bits into a single element. So the maximum possible value for an element is the sum of all the bits (if all are combined into one element). So the sum of squares would be (sum of all bits)^2 plus zeros for the other elements. But if k is larger than 1, then the sum of squares is (sum of all bits)^2 + 0 + ... (k-1 times). But if k is larger than the number of bits, then each element can have at most one bit, and the sum of squares is the sum of the squares of the k largest bits. Wait, but if there are more bits than k, then we can't have each element with one bit. Because the total_bits is the number of bits. So if there are m bits and k elements, and m >=k, then the maximum sum of squares is the sum of the squares of the k largest bits. Because each element can have at most one bit (since m >=k), so the sum of squares is the sum of the squares of the k largest bits.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because if you have m bits and k elements, and m >=k, then you can have each of the k elements have one bit, and the sum of squares is the sum of the squares of the k largest bits. But if you can combine some bits into the same element, then the sum of squares would be higher. For example, if you have two bits (say 8 and 4) and k=1. Then the sum of squares is (8+4)^2=144. Which is higher than 8^2=64. So when k is less than the number of bits, combining as many bits as possible into the same elements gives a higher sum.

So the problem is to distribute the total_bits (which is the sum of all the bits in the array) into k elements such that the sum of their squares is maximized. The way to do this is to group the highest possible bits into the same elements as much as possible.

So the approach is:

1. Count the total number of set bits (total_bits) in the array. Because the operations can't change this number.

2. Then, the problem reduces to selecting k elements, each of which can have any number of bits (summing to total_bits), such that the sum of their squares is maximized.

But how to model this. Let's think of the bits as a list sorted in descending order of their positions. For example, the highest bit is first, then the next, etc. Then, the maximum sum of squares is achieved by combining as many bits as possible into the first element, then as many as possible into the second, and so on, until we have k elements.

But how to compute this. Let's think of the bits as a list sorted in descending order. For example, the bits are in positions 3, 2, 1, 0. So the list is [8,4,2,1]. The sum of squares for k=2 would be (8+4+2+1)^2 + 0 = 15² = 225. But if k=2 and the bits are 8,4,2,1, then the sum of squares is 15² +0. But if the bits are 8,4,2,1, and k=3, then the sum of squares is 15² +0 +0. But if k=4, then the sum is 8² +4² +2² +1² = 64+16+4+1=85.

Wait, but in this case, the total_bits is 4. So when k=4, each element can have one bit, and the sum of squares is 8²+4²+2²+1²=85. But if we could combine some bits, but since k=4, we can't. So the maximum sum is 85.

So the approach is:

- If the number of bits (m) is less than or equal to k, then the maximum sum is the sum of the squares of the m largest bits. Because each element can have at most one bit, and we can select all m bits. But wait, if m is less than k, then we have to select m elements (each with one bit) and the remaining k-m elements are zero. So the sum is the sum of squares of the m largest bits.

- If m is greater than k, then we can combine the largest bits into groups. For example, the first element can take the largest (m - (k-1)) bits, and the remaining k-1 elements take one bit each. Because (m - (k-1)) + (k-1) = m. So the sum of squares would be (sum of the first (m -k +1) bits)^2 + sum of squares of the next (k-1) bits.

Wait, let's see. For example, m=5, k=2. Then, the first element takes 5-1=4 bits, the second takes 1. Sum of squares is (sum of 4 bits)^2 + (sum of 1 bit)^2. Which is better than taking 3 and 2 bits. Because (sum of 4 bits) is larger than (sum of 3 bits) + (sum of 2 bits). Wait, no. Let's take an example. Suppose the bits are 8,4,2,1,0.5 (but bits are integers, so perhaps 8,4,2,1,0.5 is not possible. Let's use 8,4,2,1,0.5 is not possible. So perhaps the example is not correct.
