Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the maximum possible OR of all elements in the array after performing at most k multiply by 2 operations. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, the problem says that in each operation, I can choose any element and multiply it by 2. And I can do this up to k times. The goal is to maximize the OR of all elements. Hmm.

The OR operation is a bitwise operation. So, the higher the bits set in the OR result, the better. So, to maximize the OR, I need to set as many high bits as possible. But how do the multiply operations help with that?

Let me think. When you multiply a number by 2, it's equivalent to shifting its bits to the left by 1. So, for example, 12 is 1100 in binary. Multiply by 2 becomes 24 (11000). So each multiplication adds a zero at the end, shifting left.

But how does this affect the OR of the entire array? Each time I multiply an element, I can potentially set a higher bit in the OR result. So the strategy might be to use the k operations to set the highest possible bits in the OR.

Wait, but the OR is cumulative. Once a bit is set in any element, it remains set. So the key is to find which bits can be set by applying the multiply operations to some elements, and how to maximize the OR by choosing the right elements and the right number of multiplications.

But how do I model this? Let's think of the bits from the highest possible down to the lowest. For each bit position, decide whether we can set it in the OR by using some of the k operations.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a bitwise greedy approach. Start from the highest possible bit and see if we can set it in the OR. For each bit, check if by applying some operations to the elements, we can set this bit. If yes, then we set it and subtract the number of operations used, then proceed to lower bits.

But how to check if a particular bit can be set given the remaining k operations?

Wait, here's an idea. Let's consider each bit from the highest possible (like 30 or 63, depending on the maximum possible value) down to 0. For each bit position i, we want to see if we can set this bit in the OR by using up to k operations. Once a bit is set, it contributes to the maximum OR, so we need to set as many high bits as possible.

But how do the multiply operations help set a particular bit? Let's think. For a given element, multiplying it by 2 shifts its bits left. So, for example, if an element has a bit set at position j, then after m multiplications, that bit will be at position j + m. So, to set a higher bit in the OR, we can multiply elements that have lower bits set, thereby shifting them up.

So, for each bit position i, we can check if there's a way to use some of the remaining k operations to have at least one element in the array have a bit set at position i. But how?

Alternatively, for each bit i from high to low, we can check if there's a way to use the remaining k operations to set this bit in the OR. If yes, we do so, subtract the used operations, and proceed.

But how to compute the number of operations needed to set a particular bit i in the OR.

Let's think. For a particular bit i, to have it set in the OR, at least one element in the array must have that bit set after some number of multiplications. So for each element, we can compute how many multiplications are needed to reach at least bit i. Then, for each element, the minimal number of multiplications needed to have that element's shifted value contribute to bit i.

Wait, perhaps for each element, the number of shifts (multiplications) required to have a bit set at position i is (i - current_bit_position) + 1. Wait, maybe not. Let's take an example. Suppose an element is 3 (binary 11). If we multiply it once, it becomes 6 (110). So the original bits are at positions 1 and 0. After one multiplication, the bits are at positions 2 and 1. So to have a bit at position i, the element's original bits plus the number of shifts (m) must be >= i. So for each element, the minimal m required to have a bit in position i is max(0, i - (original bit position of the element) + 1). Wait, maybe not. Let's see.

Wait, the original element has some bits. When you multiply by 2 m times, each bit in the original number is shifted left by m positions. So, for example, if the original number has a bit set at position j, then after m multiplications, that bit is at position j + m. So, to have a bit set at position i, we need j + m >= i. So m >= i - j. But j can be any position where the original number has a bit set.

So for each element, the minimal number of multiplications needed to have a bit set at position i is the minimal m such that there exists a bit j in the original number where j + m >= i. The minimal m for that element would be (i - j) if j < i, but if j >= i, then m can be 0. Wait, but if j is already >= i, then the element already has a bit set at i or higher. So in that case, m can be 0.

So for each element, the minimal m required to have a bit set at i is the minimal m such that (original bit positions of the element) + m >= i. The minimal m for that element is max(0, i - (max_bit_pos of the element) + 1) ? Wait, maybe not. Let's think again.

Wait, for example, if the element is 5 (101), which has bits at positions 2 and 0. Suppose i is 3. Then, the bits after m multiplications would be at positions 2 + m and 0 + m. To have a bit at position 3, we need 2 + m >=3 (so m >=1) or 0 + m >=3 (m >=3). The minimal m here is 1. So for this element, the minimal m to have a bit at 3 is 1.

So for each element, the minimal m required to have a bit set at i is the minimal m such that any of the original bits j in the element satisfies j + m >= i. The minimal m for that element is the minimal (i - j) for all j in the original bits, but only if j < i. If j >=i, then m can be 0.

Wait, but for each element, the minimal m is the minimal number of shifts needed so that after shifting, the element has a bit at or above i. So for each element, the minimal m is the minimal value such that (original bit positions) + m >= i. So for each element, the minimal m is the minimal (i - j) where j is a bit position in the original element, and j <= i. If there are no bits in the original element that are <=i, then it's impossible for this element to contribute to bit i even after shifting.

Wait, no. Because if the original element has a bit higher than i, then after shifting, that bit will be even higher. So if the original element has a bit at j >=i, then m=0 is sufficient. So for such elements, the minimal m is 0.

So for each element, the minimal m required to have a bit set at i is 0 if the element already has a bit set at or above i. Otherwise, it's the minimal (i - j) where j is a bit in the original element. But if the original element has no bits <=i, then it's impossible for this element to contribute to bit i even after shifting.

Wait, no. For example, if the original element is 8 (1000), which has a bit at position 3. If i is 2, then the original element's bit is at 3, which is higher than 2. So m=0 is sufficient. So the minimal m is 0.

So for each element, the minimal m required to have a bit set at i is 0 if the element has any bit >=i. Otherwise, it's the minimal (i - j) where j is a bit in the element, but only if j <=i-1. If the element has no bits in the original that are <=i-1, then even after shifting, it can't reach i. So such elements can't contribute to bit i.

So, for each bit i, we can collect all the minimal m's required for each element. Then, the minimal m among all elements (since we can choose to apply the minimal m to one element to set the bit i in the OR) is the number of operations needed to set bit i.

Wait, but to set bit i in the OR, we need at least one element to have that bit set. So for each element, the minimal m required to have that element contribute to bit i. Then, the minimal m across all elements (since we can choose the element that requires the least m to set the bit) is the cost to set bit i.

But how do we compute this for each bit?

So here's the plan:

1. For each bit i from highest possible (like 30 or 60) down to 0:

   a. For each element in nums, compute the minimal number of multiplications (m) needed so that after m multiplications, the element has a bit set at position i or higher. The minimal m for the element is 0 if the element already has a bit set at i or higher. Otherwise, it's the minimal (i - j) where j is a bit in the original element, but only if j <=i. If the element has no bits <=i, then it's impossible for this element to contribute to bit i even after shifting. So for such elements, the m is infinity (or a very large number, meaning we can't use this element to set bit i).

   b. Collect all the minimal m's for each element. For elements that can't contribute (m is infinity), ignore them.

   c. Find the minimal m among all elements. Let's call this min_m. If there are no elements that can contribute (all m are infinity), then we can't set this bit, so proceed to the next lower bit.

   d. If the remaining k allows us to use min_m (i.e., k >= min_m), then we can set this bit. Subtract min_m from k, and add this bit to the result. Then, proceed to the next lower bit.

   e. If not, we can't set this bit, so proceed.

But wait, this approach may not work because once we set a higher bit, the lower bits may not be set. But since OR is cumulative, once a higher bit is set, the lower bits can't affect it. So the approach of greedily setting the highest possible bits first is correct.

But how do we track which elements have been multiplied how many times? Because once we multiply an element m times, that affects all higher bits. For example, if we multiply an element once to set a higher bit, then when considering lower bits, that same element may have been shifted multiple times, which could affect the minimal m for lower bits.

Ah, right. So the problem is that the multiplications are applied to elements, and each multiplication affects all bits. So the approach of considering each bit in isolation, and tracking the remaining k, may not account for the fact that applying m multiplications to an element for a higher bit will affect the minimal m required for lower bits.

This complicates things. Because the order in which we apply the multiplications matters. For example, if we use some multiplications to set a higher bit, then those same multiplications may help in setting lower bits.

Wait, but when you multiply an element by 2 m times, that's equivalent to shifting it left m times. So the element's value becomes original * 2^m. So, for example, if you have an element that is 3 (11), and you multiply it once, it becomes 6 (110). Multiply again, 12 (1100), etc. So each multiplication increases the value, and shifts all bits to the left.

So, if you have an element that you multiply m times, then for all bits higher than or equal to the original bits shifted by m, those bits are set. So, when considering lower bits, the same element may have already been shifted, which could help in setting those bits.

But in the approach I was thinking of, when we process bits from high to low, once we decide to use m multiplications on an element for a higher bit, that element's shifted value will have higher bits set, which may help in setting lower bits. But how do we account for that in the algorithm?

Hmm. This suggests that the initial approach may not work because it doesn't track the state of the elements after each multiplication. For example, if we use m multiplications on an element to set a higher bit, then when processing lower bits, that element's bits are already shifted, which could allow us to set those lower bits with fewer multiplications.

But how can we model this in a way that's efficient, especially given the constraints (n up to 1e5 and k up to 15)?

This seems challenging. Let's think of possible optimizations.

Alternative approach: Since k is small (up to 15), perhaps we can model the problem by considering all possible ways to distribute the k multiplications among the elements, and compute the maximum OR. But with n up to 1e5, this is impossible because the number of possibilities is combinatorial.

So that's not feasible.

Another idea: For each element, the number of possible multiplications is up to k. But even that, for n=1e5 and k=15, the possibilities are way too many.

So we need a smarter approach.

Let me think again about the bitwise approach. Let's consider that the maximum OR is built by setting the highest possible bits. For each bit i from high to low, we check if we can set it given the remaining k operations, considering the current state of the elements.

But how to track the current state of the elements? Because each multiplication affects all bits of the element.

Wait, perhaps the key insight is that once a bit i is set in the OR, any further operations on elements that don't affect that bit are irrelevant. So, the problem is to find the highest possible bits that can be set, using the k operations.

But how to model the minimal number of operations required to set a particular bit, considering that previous operations may have already shifted some elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to apply all k operations to a single element. Because multiplying a single element multiple times can set higher bits, which may contribute more to the OR than spreading the operations across multiple elements.

Wait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, in the first sample input, applying the operation to the second element (9) once gives 18, which ORs with 12 to 30. If you apply the operation to the first element (12) once, you get 24, which ORs with 9 to 25 (24 |9 is 25). So in that case, applying the operation to the second element is better.

But in the second example, applying two operations to the first element (8) gives 32, which ORs with 1 and 2 to 35. If you spread the operations, like applying one to 8 and one to 1, you get 16 and 2, which ORs to 18 |2 = 18 | 2 = 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 = 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 = 18 | 2 = 18 | 2 = 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 = 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 = 18 | 2 = 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 = 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 = 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 is 18 | 2 is 18 |
