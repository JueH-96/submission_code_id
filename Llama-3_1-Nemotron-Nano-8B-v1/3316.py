Okay, let's see. I need to find the sum of the minimum absolute differences in all possible k-length subsequences of the given array. Hmm. The problem says that for each subsequence of length k, the power is the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in it, and I have to sum all those powers. Oh right, and return it modulo 1e9+7.

First, I need to think about how to approach this. The straightforward way would be to generate all possible k-length subsequences, compute the minimum difference for each, and sum them up. But wait, the constraints say that n can be up to 50. The number of possible subsequences is C(50, k), which for k=25 is around 2.25e13. That's way too big. So a brute-force approach is impossible here. So I need a smarter way.

So, the key is to find a way to compute the contribution of each possible pair of elements (i,j) where i < j, such that in the subsequence, the minimum difference is |nums[i] - nums[j]|, and then count how many such subsequences include both i and j, and all other elements are either between them or outside, but such that there's no pair in the subsequence with a smaller difference than this pair. Wait, that's complicated.

Alternatively, maybe we can pre-sort the array. Because if the array is sorted, then the minimum difference in a subsequence is the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted subsequence. Because once the array is sorted, the closest elements are adjacent. So for a sorted subsequence, the minimum difference is the minimum of the differences between consecutive elements. So, for example, in the first example, the sorted array is [1,2,3,4]. The subsequences of length 3 are [1,2,3], [1,3,4], [1,2,4], [2,3,4]. The minimum differences are 1 (2-1), 1 (3-2), 1 (4-3) for the first subsequence. Wait no, wait. Wait, the first example's explanation says the sum is 4. Let me check. The first subsequence [1,2,3] has differences 1 and 1. The minimum is 1. The second [1,3,4] has differences 2 and 1, so min is 1. The third [1,2,4] has differences 1 and 2, min is 1. The fourth [2,3,4] has differences 1 and 1, min is 1. So sum is 1+1+1+1=4. Oh right. So each of these contributes 1. So the sum is 4.

So, if the array is sorted, then the minimum difference in a subsequence is the minimum of the differences between consecutive elements in the subsequence. So, for a sorted array, the problem reduces to considering all possible k-length subsequences (which are also sorted), and for each, find the minimum of the consecutive differences, then sum all those minima.

But how to compute this efficiently?

Hmm. Let's think of the sorted array. Let's sort the array first. Then, for each possible pair of elements (i, j) where i < j, we can compute how many subsequences include both i and j, and all elements in the subsequence are between i and j (since the array is sorted, the subsequence is a subset of the sorted array, so elements are in order). Wait, but the subsequence can have elements outside of i and j as well. Wait, no. Because the array is sorted, any subsequence is a selection of elements in order. So, for example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], a subsequence [1,3,4] is formed by selecting indices 0, 2, 3. So the elements between 1 and 3 (like 2) are not included. But in this case, the consecutive differences are 2 (3-1) and 1 (4-3). The minimum is 1.

But the key idea is that the minimum difference in the subsequence is determined by the closest pair in the subsequence. So, for a sorted array, the minimum difference in a subsequence is the minimum of the differences between consecutive elements in the subsequence. So, the minimal difference in the subsequence is the minimal of all consecutive pairs in the subsequence.

So, the problem reduces to: for each possible pair of elements (i, j) in the sorted array where j = i+1 (since the array is sorted, consecutive elements have the minimal possible difference), compute how many subsequences of size k include this pair and have all other elements in the subsequence either before i, between i and j, or after j, but such that there are no other consecutive pairs in the subsequence with a difference smaller than (nums[j] - nums[i]). Wait, but that's not possible because the array is sorted. So, the minimal difference in the subsequence is the minimal of the consecutive differences in the subsequence. So, for a given consecutive pair (i, i+1) in the original array, the difference d = nums[i+1] - nums[i]. If this pair is present in the subsequence, then the minimal difference in the subsequence could be d, but only if there are no other consecutive pairs in the subsequence with a smaller difference.

Wait, but if the subsequence includes a pair (i, i+1) with difference d, and another pair (j, j+1) with difference e < d, then the minimal difference of the subsequence is e, not d. So, the contribution of the pair (i, i+1) to the sum is only for those subsequences where (i, i+1) is present, and all other consecutive pairs in the subsequence have a difference >= d. But how to count that?

Alternatively, perhaps we can process the pairs in order of increasing difference. For each pair (i, i+1) with difference d, compute the number of subsequences where the minimal difference is exactly d. Then, the total sum is the sum over all d multiplied by the number of such subsequences.

So, the approach would be:

1. Sort the array.

2. Compute all consecutive differences in the sorted array. Let's call this list 'diffs', where diffs[i] = nums[i+1] - nums[i] for i from 0 to n-2.

3. Sort the diffs in increasing order. Then, for each diff d in diffs, compute how many subsequences have their minimal difference equal to d. The sum of d multiplied by the count for each d is the answer.

But how to compute the count for each d?

For a given d (which is the i-th consecutive difference in the sorted array), the minimal difference of the subsequence is d if and only if:

- The subsequence includes the pair (i, i+1) (since the array is sorted, this is the consecutive pair in the original array).

- All other consecutive pairs in the subsequence (if any) have a difference >= d.

But since the array is sorted, the consecutive pairs in the subsequence are pairs of elements that are consecutive in the original array. Wait, no. For example, a subsequence could have elements at positions 0, 2, 3. Then the consecutive pairs are (0,2) and (2,3). The differences are nums[2]-nums[0] and nums[3]-nums[2]. But in the original array, the consecutive pairs are (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), etc. So the consecutive pairs in the subsequence are not necessarily consecutive in the original array.

Wait, but the minimal difference in the subsequence is the minimal of all pairwise absolute differences. But in a sorted array, the minimal difference in a subsequence is the minimal of the consecutive elements in the subsequence. Because if you have a subsequence a1, a2, ..., am (sorted), then the minimal difference is the minimal of a_{i+1} - a_i for all i. Because any other pair a_j - a_i (j > i) is at least the sum of the consecutive differences between i and j. So, the minimal difference must be between consecutive elements in the subsequence.

So, the minimal difference in the subsequence is the minimal of the consecutive differences in the subsequence. Therefore, the minimal difference is the minimal of the consecutive differences in the subsequence. So, for the entire problem, the minimal difference of a subsequence is the minimal of the consecutive differences in the subsequence.

So, the problem reduces to: for each possible consecutive pair in the subsequence (which may not be consecutive in the original array), compute how many times their difference is the minimal in the subsequence, and sum all those differences multiplied by their counts.

But how to compute this efficiently?

Alternative approach: For each possible pair of elements (i, j) in the sorted array (i < j), compute the number of subsequences of size k that include i and j, and all elements in the subsequence are between i and j (since the array is sorted, the subsequence is a subset of the elements between i and j, inclusive). Wait, no. Because the subsequence can have elements outside of i and j. For example, in the first example, the subsequence [1,2,4] includes 1,2,4. The consecutive differences are 1 and 2. The minimal is 1. So the pair (1,2) is part of the subsequence, and their difference is the minimal.

So, the minimal difference in the subsequence is the minimal of the consecutive differences in the subsequence. So, for each consecutive pair in the subsequence (not necessarily consecutive in the original array), we need to find how many times their difference is the minimal in the subsequence.

But this seems complicated. Let's think of the sorted array. Let's sort the array first. Then, for each possible pair (i, j) where i < j, the difference is d = nums[j] - nums[i]. But this pair is part of the subsequence. However, the minimal difference in the subsequence could be d, but only if there are no other consecutive pairs in the subsequence with a smaller difference.

Wait, but the minimal difference in the subsequence is the minimal of all consecutive differences in the subsequence. So, for a pair (i, j) in the original array (i < j), if in the subsequence, the elements between i and j are not selected, then the consecutive pairs in the subsequence could be (i, j) and others. But the minimal difference would be the minimal of all consecutive differences in the subsequence.

This seems tricky. Maybe a better approach is to pre-sort the array and then consider all possible pairs of elements (i, j) in the sorted array where j = i + m, for m >=1, and compute the number of subsequences where the minimal difference is exactly (nums[j] - nums[i]). But how?

Alternatively, let's think of the problem as follows: after sorting the array, the minimal difference in a subsequence is the minimal of the consecutive differences in the subsequence. So, for each possible consecutive difference in the subsequence (which could be between any two elements in the original array, not necessarily consecutive), we need to count how many times it is the minimal difference in a subsequence of size k.

But how to compute this?

Another idea: For each possible pair (i, j) in the sorted array (i < j), compute the number of subsequences that include i and j, and all elements in the subsequence are between i and j (so the subsequence is a subset of the elements from i to j, inclusive), and the minimal difference in the subsequence is (nums[j] - nums[i]). Then, sum over all such pairs (i,j) the product of (nums[j] - nums[i]) and the count.

But how to compute this?

Wait, but if the subsequence includes elements outside of i and j, then the minimal difference could be from a pair outside. So this approach might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal difference in the subsequence is determined by the closest pair in the subsequence. So, for each possible pair (i, j) in the sorted array (i < j), where d = nums[j] - nums[i], we can compute the number of subsequences where the minimal difference is d, and this pair is the closest pair in the subsequence.

But how to compute that?

This seems challenging. Let's think of the sorted array. For a pair (i, j) to be the closest pair in a subsequence, all other elements in the subsequence must be either <= i or >= j. Because if there's an element between i and j, then the difference between that element and i or j would be smaller than d. Wait, no. For example, if the array is [1,3,4,5], and the pair is (3,4) with d=1. If the subsequence includes 1,3,4, then the minimal difference is 1 (3-1=2, 4-3=1). So the pair (3,4) is the closest. But if the subsequence includes 3,4,5, then the minimal difference is 1 (4-3 and 5-4). So the pair (3,4) is part of the closest pairs. But if the subsequence includes 1,3,5, then the minimal difference is 2 (3-1 and 5-3). So the closest pair is (3,5) with difference 2. So in this case, the pair (3,4) is not part of the subsequence, but the minimal difference is determined by another pair.

Hmm. So the approach of considering all possible pairs (i,j) and counting the number of subsequences where (i,j) is the closest pair is not straightforward.

Alternative approach inspired by the example:

After sorting the array, the minimal difference in a subsequence is the minimal of the consecutive differences in the subsequence. So, for a subsequence S of size k, sorted, the minimal difference is the minimal of S[i+1] - S[i] for all i in 0..k-2.

So, the problem is to compute the sum over all possible k-length subsequences of the minimal of their consecutive differences.

To compute this sum efficiently, perhaps we can pre-sort the array and then for each possible consecutive pair in the original array (i, i+1), compute how many subsequences include this pair and have all other consecutive differences in the subsequence >= d, where d is the difference between i and i+1.

Wait, but the minimal difference in the subsequence is the minimal of all consecutive differences in the subsequence. So, if a subsequence includes the pair (i, i+1) with difference d, and all other consecutive differences in the subsequence are >= d, then the minimal difference of the subsequence is d. So, the contribution of this pair (i, i+1) is d multiplied by the number of such subsequences.

So, the plan is:

1. Sort the array.

2. For each consecutive pair (i, i+1) in the sorted array, compute d = nums[i+1] - nums[i].

3. For each such d, compute the number of k-length subsequences that include both i and i+1, and all other elements in the subsequence are chosen such that between i and i+1, there are no elements (since the array is sorted, the subsequence is a subset of the sorted array, so elements between i and i+1 are not present in the subsequence). Wait, no. Because the array is sorted, the elements in the subsequence are in order. So, if the subsequence includes i and i+1, then there can't be any elements between i and i+1 in the subsequence. Because the array is sorted, the elements between i and i+1 in the original array are not part of the subsequence. So, the consecutive pair (i, i+1) in the original array is part of the subsequence, and there are no elements between them in the subsequence. So, the consecutive differences in the subsequence between i and i+1 is d. Then, the other consecutive differences in the subsequence are between elements before i and i, and between i+1 and elements after i+1.

But for the minimal difference in the subsequence to be d, all other consecutive differences in the subsequence must be >= d.

So, the problem reduces to, for each consecutive pair (i, i+1) in the sorted array, compute the number of k-length subsequences that include i and i+1, and all other elements in the subsequence are either before i, after i+1, or between i and i+1 (but since the array is sorted, there are no elements between i and i+1). Wait, no. The array is sorted, so between i and i+1 in the original array, there are no elements. So, the subsequence can't have elements between i and i+1. So, the subsequence must consist of elements from the left of i, i, i+1, and elements to the right of i+1.

But the subsequence must include i and i+1. So, the subsequence is formed by selecting some elements from the left of i (including none), i, i+1, and some elements from the right of i+1 (including none), such that the total number of elements is k.

But in this case, the consecutive differences in the subsequence would be:

- Between the elements selected from the left of i and i. The minimal difference in that part is the minimal of the consecutive differences in the left part. But since the array is sorted, the left part is a subset of the sorted array. So, the consecutive differences in the left part are the same as in the original array. Similarly for the right part.

But for the minimal difference in the entire subsequence to be d (the difference between i and i+1), all other consecutive differences in the subsequence must be >= d.

So, the steps for each consecutive pair (i, i+1) are:

- The subsequence must include i and i+1.

- The elements selected from the left of i (if any) must form a subsequence where all consecutive differences are >= d.

- The elements selected from the right of i+1 (if any) must form a subsequence where all consecutive differences are >= d.

- The total number of elements selected (left elements) + 2 (i and i+1) + (right elements) = k.

So, the problem is to compute for each (i, i+1) pair, the number of ways to choose left elements (from 0 to i-1) and right elements (from i+2 to n-1) such that:

- The left elements form a subsequence where all consecutive differences are >= d.

- The right elements form a subsequence where all consecutive differences are >= d.

- The total number of elements is (left_count) + 2 + (right_count) = k.

But how to compute the number of such left and right subsequences?

This seems like a dynamic programming problem. For each position, we can precompute the number of subsequences of a certain length that end at that position and have all consecutive differences >= d.

Wait, but for each (i, i+1) pair, the d is fixed. So, for the left part (elements before i), we need to count the number of subsequences of the left part (from 0 to i-1) where all consecutive differences are >= d, and the length is l. Similarly for the right part (elements after i+1).

So, for each (i, i+1) pair, we can precompute for the left part (0 to i-1) the number of subsequences of length l (for l from 0 to i) where all consecutive differences are >= d. Similarly for the right part (i+2 to n-1) the number of subsequences of length r (for r from 0 to (n - (i+2) +1 )) where all consecutive differences are >= d.

Then, for each possible l and r such that l + r + 2 = k, the total number of subsequences for this (i, i+1) pair is (left_count[l] * right_count[r]).

So, the steps would be:

For each consecutive pair (i, i+1) in the sorted array:

1. Compute d = nums[i+1] - nums[i].

2. Compute for the left part (elements before i) the number of subsequences of each possible length (0 to i) where all consecutive differences are >= d.

3. Compute for the right part (elements after i+1) the number of subsequences of each possible length (0 to (n - (i+2) +1 )) where all consecutive differences are >= d.

4. For each possible l and r where l + r + 2 = k, add left_count[l] * right_count[r] to the total contribution for this pair.

5. Multiply the total contribution by d and add to the overall sum.

But how to compute the left_count and right_count for each possible d?

This seems manageable. Let's think about how to compute the left_count for a given array segment and a given d.

For example, the left part is the array from 0 to i-1. We need to compute for each possible length l, the number of subsequences of length l where all consecutive differences are >= d.

This is similar to the problem of counting the number of increasing subsequences with certain properties, but here the property is that consecutive elements in the subsequence have differences >= d.

We can model this with dynamic programming. Let's define dp[pos][len] as the number of subsequences ending at position pos (in the left part) with length len, and all consecutive differences in the subsequence are >= d.

The base case is dp[pos][1] = 1 for all pos (a subsequence of length 1 has no consecutive pairs, so the condition is trivially satisfied).

For len >=2, dp[pos][len] = sum_{j < pos, nums[pos] - nums[j] >= d} dp[j][len-1].

But this approach would be O(m^3) for a segment of length m, which could be up to 50. For each (i, i+1) pair, the left and right parts can be up to 50 elements each. So for each pair, the left and right parts would take O(m^3) time. Since there are up to 49 consecutive pairs (since n can be up to 50), the total time would be O(49 * 50^3) which is acceptable for Python.

But wait, the left part for a pair (i, i+1) is the elements before i. So for i=0, the left part is empty. For i=1, the left part is the first element, etc. So the left part can be up to 49 elements (if i is 49, but n is 50, then i+1 is 50, which is out of bounds. So the maximum i is n-2, which is 48 for n=50. So the left part can be up to 48 elements. So the left and right parts can be up to 48 elements each. So the DP for each part would be O(m^3), which for m=48 is 48^3 = 110,592 per part. Multiply by 49 pairs, that's 49 * 2 * 110,592 = around 10 million operations, which is manageable.

So, the plan is:

Sort the array.

For each consecutive pair (i, i+1) in the sorted array:

   d = nums[i+1] - nums[i]

   left_part = nums[0 ... i-1]

   right_part = nums[i+2 ... n-1]

   compute left_counts: a list where left_counts[l] is the number of subsequences of left_part of length l with all consecutive differences >= d.

   compute right_counts: a list where right_counts[r] is the number of subsequences of right_part of length r with all consecutive differences >= d.

   for l in 0 to len(left_part):

       for r in 0 to len(right_part):

           if l + r + 2 == k:

               total += left_counts[l] * right_counts[r] * d

So, the key is to compute left_counts and right_counts for each d.

Now, how to compute left_counts and right_counts.

Let's take the left_part as an example. We need to compute for each possible length l, the number of subsequences of the left_part of length l where all consecutive differences are >= d.

We can model this with dynamic programming. Let's create a 2D array dp where dp[pos][len] represents the number of subsequences ending at position pos (in the left_part) with length len, and all consecutive differences in the subsequence are >= d.

The base case is dp[pos][1] = 1 for all pos (since a subsequence of length 1 has no consecutive pairs, so the condition is satisfied).

For len >=2, for each position pos, we can look at all previous positions j < pos where nums[pos] - nums[j] >= d. Then, dp[pos][len] += dp[j][len-1].

But since the left_part is sorted (since the original array is sorted), the elements are in increasing order. So, for j < pos, nums[j] <= nums[pos]. So, the difference is nums[pos] - nums[j] >= d.

But since the array is sorted, for j < pos, nums[j] <= nums[pos]. So, the difference is non-negative.

So, for the left_part, which is sorted, the problem reduces to finding subsequences where each consecutive pair in the subsequence has a difference >= d.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Let's think of the left_part as a sorted array. For each element in the left_part, we can track the maximum j where nums[pos] - nums[j] >= d. Since the array is sorted, for a given pos, all j's from 0 to some index m will satisfy nums[pos] - nums[j] >= d. Because the array is sorted, once we find the first j where nums[pos] - nums[j] < d, all j's after that will also have nums[pos] - nums[j] < d.

Wait, no. Since the array is sorted in increasing order, for j < pos, nums[j] <= nums[pos]. So, nums[pos] - nums[j] is >=0. For a given d, we can find the smallest j where nums[pos] - nums[j] >= d. All j's <= that j will satisfy the condition. Wait, no. For example, if the array is [1,3,5,7], and d=2. For pos=2 (element 5), the j's that satisfy 5 - nums[j] >=2 are j=0 (5-1=4 >=2), j=1 (5-3=2 >=2). So j can be 0 or 1. So for each pos, the valid j's are those where nums[j] <= nums[pos] -d.

So, for each pos, the valid j's are the elements in the left_part up to the maximum j where nums[j] <= nums[pos] -d. Since the left_part is sorted, we can use binary search to find this j.

So, for each pos in the left_part, we can precompute the maximum j where nums[j] <= nums[pos] -d. Let's call this j_max for pos. Then, all j's from 0 to j_max are valid.

But how to compute the number of subsequences ending at pos with length len.

Alternatively, for each pos, and for each possible len, we can compute the sum of dp[j][len-1] for all j <= j_max.

But this would be O(m^2 * len) time, which for m=50 and len up to 50 is manageable.

But perhaps we can optimize this by precomputing prefix sums.

Let's think of the DP for the left_part. For each len, we can compute a prefix sum array that allows us to quickly compute the sum of dp[j][len-1] for j up to j_max.

For example, for len=2, the number of subsequences ending at pos with len=2 is the sum of dp[j][1] for all j <= j_max. Since dp[j][1] is 1 for all j, this sum is j_max +1 (since j ranges from 0 to j_max, inclusive). So for len=2, the count is j_max +1.

For len=3, the count is the sum of dp[j][2] for j <= j_max. But dp[j][2] is the number of subsequences of length 2 ending at j. So, for each j, we can precompute the sum up to j_max.

But this seems complicated. Let's proceed step by step.

The DP for the left_part:

Initialize a 2D array dp where dp[pos][l] is the number of subsequences ending at pos with length l, and all consecutive differences >=d.

Initialize dp[pos][1] = 1 for all pos.

For l from 2 to max_length (which is the length of the left_part):

   for each pos in 0 to len(left_part)-1:

       j_max = the largest index j where left_part[j] <= left_part[pos] -d.

       sum_prev = sum of dp[j][l-1] for j from 0 to j_max.

       dp[pos][l] = sum_prev

But how to compute j_max efficiently. Since the left_part is sorted, we can use binary search for each pos.

So, for each pos, compute the maximum j where left_part[j] <= left_part[pos] -d. This can be done with bisect_right.

Once we have j_max, the sum_prev is the sum of dp[j][l-1] for j from 0 to j_max.

But summing up to j_max for each pos and l can be time-consuming. To optimize, we can precompute prefix sums for each l.

For example, for each l, we can compute a prefix sum array s where s[pos] = sum_{j=0 to pos} dp[j][l]. Then, for a given j_max, the sum_prev is s[j_max].

So, the steps would be:

For the left_part:

Compute for each l from 1 to max_len:

   compute the prefix sums for dp[j][l].

   for each pos in 0 to len(left_part)-1:

       if l ==1:

           dp[pos][1] =1

       else:

           j_max = bisect.bisect_right(left_part, left_part[pos] -d) -1

           if j_max >=0:

               sum_prev = prefix_sum[l-1][j_max]

               dp[pos][l] = sum_prev

           else:

               dp[pos][l] =0

But how to manage the prefix sums. For each l, we can compute the prefix sum array for l-1.

Alternatively, for each l, after computing all dp[j][l], we can compute the prefix sum array for l.

But this would require O(m^2) time for each l, which is acceptable.

So, the algorithm for left_part:

max_len = len(left_part)

dp_left = [[0]*(max_len+1) for _ in range(max_len)]  # dp[pos][l] for 0<=l<=max_len

prefix = [[0]*(max_len+1) for _ in range(max_len+1)]  # prefix_sum[l][pos] = sum of dp[j][l] for j up to pos.

for pos in 0 to max_len-1:

   dp_left[pos][1] =1

for l in 2 to max_len:

   for pos in 0 to max_len-1:

       j_max = bisect.bisect_right(left_part, left_part[pos] -d) -1

       if j_max >=0:

           sum_prev = prefix[l-1][j_max]

       else:

           sum_prev =0

       dp_left[pos][l] = sum_prev

   # compute prefix sums for l

   prefix[l][0] = dp_left[0][l]

   for j in 1 to max_len-1:

       prefix[l][j] = prefix[l][j-1] + dp_left[j][l]

But wait, the prefix sum for l is the sum of dp[j][l] for j up to pos. So, for each l, the prefix sum array is built.

But for l=1, the prefix sum is just the sum of 1's up to pos.

But this approach would require O(m^2) time for each l, which for m=50 is manageable.

Once we have the dp_left, the left_counts[l] is the sum of dp_left[pos][l] for all pos in 0..max_len-1.

Similarly for the right_part.

So, for the left_part, after computing dp_left, the left_counts is a list where left_counts[l] is the sum of dp_left[pos][l] for all pos.

Similarly for the right_part.

Once we have left_counts and right_counts, we can compute the contribution for each (i, i+1) pair.

But wait, the left_part is the elements before i. So, the left_part is nums[0..i-1], which is sorted. Similarly for the right_part.

So, the code steps would be:

Sort the array.

Initialize the total sum to 0.

For each i in 0 to n-2:

   d = nums[i+1] - nums[i]

   left_part = nums[0..i-1]

   right_part = nums[i+2..n-1]

   compute left_counts: for each possible l, the number of subsequences of left_part of length l with all consecutive differences >=d.

   compute right_counts: same for right_part.

   for l in 0 to len(left_part):

       for r in 0 to len(right_part):

           if l + r + 2 ==k:

               total += left_counts[l] * right_counts[r] * d

So, the code needs to compute left_counts and right_counts for each pair (i, i+1).

Now, the code for computing left_counts and right_counts.

But how to handle the case when the left_part is empty (i=0). Then, left_counts[0] =1 (the empty subsequence), and left_counts[l] =0 for l>0.

Similarly for the right_part.

So, the code for left_part:

if left_part is empty:

   left_counts = [1] + [0]*(max_possible_length -1)

else:

   compute dp_left as described, then sum over all pos for each l.

But in code, for left_part:

max_len_left = len(left_part)

left_counts = [0]*(max_len_left +1)

for l in 0 to max_len_left:

   sum over all pos in left_part of dp_left[pos][l]

But for l=0, the empty subsequence is allowed. Wait, but in the problem, the subsequence must have length k. So, when we are considering the left_part, the empty subsequence (l=0) is allowed, which contributes 1 way. So, for the left_part, the left_counts[0] is 1 (the empty subsequence), and for l>=1, it's the sum of dp_left[pos][l] for all pos.

Wait, no. Because the left_part is the elements before i. The left_part can contribute a subsequence of length l (0 <= l <= len(left_part)). For l=0, it's the empty subsequence. For l >=1, it's a non-empty subsequence of the left_part.

But in the code for the left_part, the dp_left[pos][l] counts the number of subsequences ending at pos with length l. So, the total number of subsequences of length l in the left_part is the sum of dp_left[pos][l] for all pos. For l=0, it's 1 (the empty subsequence). For l>=1, it's the sum.

So, the code for left_counts would be:

left_counts = [0]*(max_len_left +1)

left_counts[0] =1  # empty subsequence

for l in 1 to max_len_left:

   sum over all pos in left_part of dp_left[pos][l]

But wait, the empty subsequence is allowed in the left_part. So, when the left_part is non-empty, the left_counts[0] is 1. For example, if the left_part has 3 elements, then the empty subsequence is allowed, and the left_counts[0] is 1.

But in the code for the left_part, when the left_part is non-empty, the code for left_counts[0] is 1, and for l>=1, it's the sum of dp_left[pos][l] for all pos.

So, the code for left_counts is:

left_counts = [0]*(max_len_left +1)

left_counts[0] =1  # empty subsequence

for l in 1 to max_len_left:

   total =0

   for pos in 0 to max_len_left-1:

       total += dp_left[pos][l]

   left_counts[l] = total

Similarly for right_counts.

But how to handle the case when the left_part is empty. For example, when i=0, the left_part is empty. So, max_len_left is 0. So, left_counts is [1], and for l>0, left_counts[l] is 0.

So, the code for left_part:

if left_part is empty:

   left_counts = [1]

else:

   compute dp_left as described, then compute left_counts as above.

Now, putting this all together.

The code steps:

Sort the array.

Initialize total =0.

For each i in 0 to n-2:

   d = nums[i+1] - nums[i]

   left_part = nums[0..i-1]

   right_part = nums[i+2..n-1]

   compute left_counts and right_counts for d.

   for l in 0 to len(left_part):

       for r in 0 to len(right_part):

           if l + r +2 ==k:

               total += left_counts[l] * right_counts[r] *d

   total %= MOD

But wait, the modulo is 1e9+7. So, after each addition, we take modulo.

Now, the code for computing left_counts and right_counts.

Implementing the dynamic programming for left_part and right_part.

But how to handle the DP for left_part and right_part.

Let's write a helper function that, given a list (which is sorted) and a d, returns a list of counts for each possible length l (from 0 to len(list)) of the number of subsequences of the list with length l and all consecutive differences >=d.

The helper function:

def compute_counts(arr, d):

    m = len(arr)

    if m ==0:

        return [1]  # only the empty subsequence

    # Initialize dp and prefix sums.

    # dp[pos][l] is the number of subsequences ending at pos with length l.

    max_len = m

    dp = [[0]*(max_len+1) for _ in range(m)]

    # prefix_sum[l][pos] is the sum of dp[j][l] for j up to pos.

    prefix = [[0]*(m) for _ in range(max_len+1)]

    # Initialize for l=1.

    for pos in range(m):

        dp[pos][1] =1

    # Compute prefix sums for l=1.

    prefix[1][0] =1

    for pos in range(1, m):

        prefix[1][pos] = prefix[1][pos-1] +1

    # Compute for l >=2.

    for l in range(2, max_len+1):

        for pos in range(m):

            # Find j_max: the largest j where arr[j] <= arr[pos] -d.

            target = arr[pos] -d

            j_max = bisect.bisect_right(arr, target) -1

            if j_max >=0:

                # sum_prev is sum of dp[j][l-1] for j up to j_max.

                sum_prev = prefix[l-1][j_max]

            else:

                sum_prev =0

            dp[pos][l] = sum_prev

        # Compute prefix sums for this l.

        prefix[l][0] = dp[0][l]

        for pos in range(1, m):

            prefix[l][pos] = prefix[l][pos-1] + dp[pos][l]

    # Now, compute the counts for each l.

    counts = [0]*(max_len+1)

    counts[0] =1  # empty subsequence

    for l in range(1, max_len+1):

        total =0

        for pos in range(m):

            total += dp[pos][l]

        counts[l] = total

    return counts

Wait, but the prefix array is for each l, the sum up to pos. So, for l=2, prefix[2][pos] is the sum of dp[j][2] for j up to pos.

But in the code above, for each l >=2, after computing dp[pos][l] for all pos, we compute the prefix sums for that l.

But in the code, the prefix is a 2D array where prefix[l][pos] is the sum of dp[j][l] for j up to pos.

So, for each l, after filling the dp for that l, we compute the prefix sums.

But in the code, the prefix is initialized as a (max_len+1) x m array. For l up to max_len (which is m), and pos up to m-1.

So, the code for the helper function seems correct.

But let's test it with a small example.

Example: left_part = [1,3], d=1.

The array is sorted. For l=2:

For pos=0 (element 1), l=2: j_max is the largest j where 1 - arr[j] >=1. But arr[j] <=1-1=0. Since the array is [1,3], there are no elements <=0. So j_max is -1. So dp[0][2] =0.

For pos=1 (element 3), l=2: j_max is the largest j where 3 - arr[j] >=1. So arr[j] <=2. The elements are 1 and 3. So j can be 0 (1 <=2). So j_max=0. sum_prev is prefix[1][0] =1. So dp[1][2] =1.

So, counts[2] =0 +1 =1.

So, the helper function returns counts[2] =1. Which is correct, as the subsequence [1,3] has a difference of 2 >=1.

So, the code seems to work.

Another example: left_part = [1,2,3], d=1.

For l=2:

pos=0: 1-arr[j] >=1 → arr[j] <=0 → j_max=-1 → dp[0][2] =0.

pos=1: 2-arr[j] >=1 → arr[j] <=1. j can be 0. sum_prev is prefix[1][0] =1 → dp[1][2] =1.

pos=2: 3-arr[j] >=1 → arr[j] <=2. j can be 0,1. sum_prev is prefix[1][1] =2 → dp[2][2] =2.

So counts[2] =0+1+2=3. Which corresponds to the subsequences [1,2], [1,3], [2,3]. All have differences >=1.

Yes.

So, the helper function seems to work.

Now, putting it all together.

The code for the problem:

Sort the array.

For each consecutive pair (i, i+1):

   compute d.

   compute left_part and right_part.

   compute left_counts and right_counts.

   for l and r such that l + r +2 =k:

       add left_counts[l] * right_counts[r] *d to the total.

But wait, the left_part is the elements before i. So, the left_part is nums[0..i-1], which is sorted. The right_part is nums[i+2..n-1], which is also sorted.

So, the code:

class Solution:

    def sumOfPowers(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:

        MOD = 10**9 +7

        nums.sort()

        n = len(nums)

        total =0

        for i in range(n-1):

            d = nums[i+1] - nums[i]

            left_part = nums[:i]

            right_part = nums[i+2:]

            left_counts = self.compute_counts(left_part, d)

            right_counts = self.compute_counts(right_part, d)

            max_l = len(left_part)

            max_r = len(right_part)

            for l in range(max_l +1):

                for r in range(max_r +1):

                    if l + r +2 ==k:

                        total = (total + left_counts[l] * right_counts[r] * d) % MOD

        return total

    def compute_counts(self, arr, d):

        m = len(arr)

        if m ==0:

            return [1]

        max_len = m

        dp = [[0]*(max_len+1) for _ in range(m)]

        prefix = [[0]*m for _ in range(max_len+1)]

        # Initialize for l=1

        for pos in range(m):

            dp[pos][1] =1

        # Compute prefix for l=1

        prefix[1][0] =1

        for pos in range(1, m):

            prefix[1][pos] = prefix[1][pos-1] +1

        # Compute for l >=2

        for l in range(2, max_len+1):

            for pos in range(m):

                target = arr[pos] -d

                j_max = bisect.bisect_right(arr, target) -1

                if j_max >=0:

                    sum_prev = prefix[l-1][j_max]

                else:

                    sum_prev =0

                dp[pos][l] = sum_prev

            # Compute prefix for this l

            prefix[l][0] = dp[0][l]

            for pos in range(1, m):

                prefix[l][pos] = prefix[l][pos-1] + dp[pos][l]

        # Compute counts

        counts = [0]*(max_len+1)

        counts[0] =1

        for l in range(1, max_len+1):

            total =0

            for pos in range(m):

                total += dp[pos][l]

            counts[l] = total

        return counts

But wait, in the compute_counts function, the 'arr' is passed. But in the code, the 'arr' is the left_part or right_part, which is a slice of the sorted nums. So, the code should work.

But let's test the first example.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k=3.

Sorted nums: [1,2,3,4].

Consecutive pairs are (0,1), (1,2), (2,3).

For each pair:

Pair (0,1), d=1.

left_part is empty. left_counts is [1].

right_part is [3,4]. compute_counts for d=1.

For right_part [3,4], d=1.

m=2.

For l=1:

each pos has dp[pos][1] =1. counts[1] =2.

For l=2:

pos=0: target=3-1=2. j_max is bisect_right([3,4], 2) -1 → 0-1= -1. sum_prev=0. dp[0][2] =0.

pos=1: target=4-1=3. bisect_right([3,4],3) is 1. j_max=0. sum_prev=prefix[1][0] =1. dp[1][2] =1.

counts[2] =0+1=1.

So, right_counts is [1, 2, 1].

So, for l=0 (left_part's left_counts[0] =1), r=1 (right_counts[1] =2). l + r +2 =0+1+2=3. So contribution is 1*2*1=2.

Also, l=0, r=2: 0+2+2=4 !=3. So no.

Other possibilities: l=0, r=1: yes. So contribution is 2.

But wait, the right_part is [3,4]. The right_counts for r=1 is 2 (subsequences of length 1: [3], [4]). For r=2, it's 1 (subsequence [3,4]).

So, for pair (0,1), the possible l and r are:

l=0, r=1: 0+1+2=3. So contribution is 1 * 2 *1 =2.

l=0, r=2: 0+2+2=4>3. No.

So, total contribution from this pair is 2.

But according to the example, the sum is 4. So there must be other pairs contributing.

Next pair (1,2), d=1.

left_part is [1,2]. compute_counts for d=1.

For left_part [1,2], d=1.

m=2.

For l=1: counts[1] =2.

For l=2:

pos=0: target=1-1=0. j_max is bisect_right([1,2],0) -1 → -1. sum_prev=0. dp[0][2] =0.

pos=1: target=2-1=1. bisect_right([1,2],1) is 1. j_max=0. sum_prev=prefix[1][0] =1. dp[1][2] =1.

counts[2] =0+1=1.

So left_counts is [1, 2, 1].

right_part is [4]. compute_counts for d=1.

m=1.

For l=1: counts[1] =1.

For l=2: not possible (m=1). So right_counts is [1,1].

So, for this pair:

possible l and r:

l can be 0,1,2.

r can be 0,1.

We need l + r +2 =3.

Possible combinations:

l=0, r=1: 0+1+2=3. contribution: left_counts[0] * right_counts[1] *1 =1 *1 *1=1.

l=1, r=0: 1+0+2=3. contribution: 2 *1 *1=2.

l=2, r= -1: no.

So total contribution from this pair is 1+2=3.

So total so far is 2+3=5.

Next pair (2,3), d=1.

left_part is [1,2,3]. compute_counts for d=1.

m=3.

For l=1: counts[1] =3.

For l=2:

pos=0: target=1-1=0. j_max=-1. sum_prev=0. dp[0][2] =0.

pos=1: target=2-1=1. j_max=0. sum_prev=prefix[1][0] =1. dp[1][2] =1.

pos=2: target=3-1=2. j_max=1. sum_prev=prefix[1][1] =2. dp[2][2] =2.

counts[2] =0+1+2=3.

For l=3:

pos=0: target=1-1=0. j_max=-1. sum_prev=0. dp[0][3] =0.

pos=1: target=2-1=1. j_max=0. sum_prev=prefix[2][0] =0. dp[1][3] =0.

pos=2: target=3-1=2. j_max=1. sum_prev=prefix[2][1] =1. dp[2][3] =1.

counts[3] =0+0+1=1.

So left_counts is [1,3,3,1].

right_part is empty. right_counts is [1].

So, for this pair:

possible l and r:

l can be 0,1,2,3.

r=0.

l +0 +2 =3 → l=1.

So contribution is left_counts[1] * right_counts[0] *1 =3 *1 *1=3.

Also, l=3: 3+0+2=5>3. No.

So contribution is 3.

Total sum is 2+3+3=8. But the example's answer is 4. So something is wrong.

Wait, this suggests that the code is not correct. What's wrong here?

Wait, the example's answer is 4, but according to the code's calculation, the sum is 2+3+3=8. So there's a mistake in the code.

Hmm. Let's see.

In the first example, the code's calculation for each pair:

Pair (0,1) (d=1):

left_part is empty. left_counts is [1].

right_part is [3,4]. right_counts is [1,2,1].

For l=0, r=1: 0+1+2=3. contribution 1*2*1=2.

Pair (1,2) (d=1):

left_part is [1,2]. left_counts is [1,2,1].

right_part is [4]. right_counts is [1,1].

Possible combinations:

l=0, r=1: 0+1+2=3. contribution 1*1*1=1.

l=1, r=0: 1+0+2=3. contribution 2*1*1=2.

Total 3.

Pair (2,3) (d=1):

left_part is [1,2,3]. left_counts is [1,3,3,1].

right_part is empty. right_counts is [1].

Possible combinations:

l=1, r=0: 1+0+2=3. contribution 3*1*1=3.

So total sum is 2+3+3=8. But the correct answer is 4.

So the code is not working correctly.

What's wrong?

Ah, I think the code is counting the same subsequence multiple times. Because a subsequence can have multiple consecutive pairs with the same minimal difference. For example, in the first example, the subsequence [1,2,3] has two consecutive pairs with difference 1. So, the code would count this subsequence for both pairs (0,1) and (1,2). But the minimal difference is 1, and it should be counted once. But the code is adding the contribution for each pair that is part of the subsequence and has difference equal to the minimal difference. But this is incorrect.

Ah, this is the problem. The code is counting each pair (i, i+1) in the original array that is part of the subsequence and has difference d, but the minimal difference of the subsequence is d. But if the subsequence has multiple pairs with difference d, then the code would count each such pair, leading to overcounting.

For example, in the subsequence [1,2,3], the minimal difference is 1. The code would count this subsequence for both pairs (0,1) and (1,2), because each of those pairs has difference 1. But the minimal difference is 1, and the code should count this subsequence once, multiplied by 1. But the code is counting it twice, once for each pair.

So, the approach is incorrect. The code is counting each pair (i, i+1) in the original array that is part of the subsequence and has difference d, but the minimal difference of the subsequence is d. But this leads to overcounting.

So, the initial approach is flawed. The code is not correctly counting the number of subsequences where the minimal difference is d, but instead counting the number of pairs (i, i+1) in the subsequence that have difference d and all other consecutive differences in the subsequence are >=d. But this is not the same as the minimal difference being d.

So, the code's approach is incorrect.

This is a critical mistake. So, the initial approach is wrong.

So, what's the correct approach?

Alternative idea: For each possible pair (i, j) in the sorted array (i < j), compute the number of subsequences where the minimal difference is exactly (nums[j] - nums[i]), and this pair is the closest pair in the subsequence.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, the minimal difference in a subsequence is the minimal of all consecutive differences in the subsequence. So, for a subsequence S, the minimal difference is the minimal of S[i+1] - S[i] for all i in 0..k-2.

So, the sum is the sum over all possible subsequences of length k of the minimal of their consecutive differences.

To compute this sum efficiently, perhaps we can use inclusion-exclusion.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea: For each possible consecutive difference d in the sorted array, compute the number of subsequences where the minimal consecutive difference is d. Then, sum d multiplied by that count.

But how to compute the count for each d.

This is similar to the initial approach, but the initial approach was incorrect because it counted each pair (i, i+1) in the subsequence that has difference d, but the minimal difference could be d even if there are other pairs with smaller differences.

Wait, no. The initial approach was to count the number of subsequences where the minimal difference is d, which is the difference of the pair (i, i+1), and all other consecutive differences in the subsequence are >=d. But this is correct.

But in the first example, the code's calculation for pair (0,1) (d=1) includes the subsequence [1,2,3], which has consecutive differences 1 and 1. The minimal difference is 1. So, this subsequence should be counted once for d=1. But according to the code, it is counted once for pair (0,1) and once for pair (1,2), leading to a total of 2 contributions of 1 each, which sum to 2. But the correct contribution for this subsequence is 1. So, the code is overcounting.

Ah, this is the problem. The code counts each pair (i, i+1) in the subsequence that has difference d and is the minimal in the subsequence. But in reality, the minimal difference is the minimal of all consecutive differences in the subsequence. So, if a subsequence has multiple pairs with difference d, and d is the minimal, then the code counts each such pair, leading to overcounting.

So, the code's approach is incorrect.

So, the initial approach is wrong. We need a different approach.

Alternative approach: For each possible pair (i, j) in the sorted array (i < j), compute the number of subsequences where the minimal difference is (nums[j] - nums[i]), and this pair is the closest pair in the subsequence.

But how to compute this.

Let's think of the sorted array. For a pair (i, j) to be the closest pair in a subsequence, the following must hold:

- The subsequence includes i and j.

- All elements between i and j in the original array are not in the subsequence. Because if there's an element between i and j in the subsequence, then the difference between i and that element or between that element and j would be smaller than nums[j] - nums[i], which contradicts the pair (i,j) being the closest.

- All elements before i in the subsequence are such that their consecutive differences are >= (nums[j] - nums[i]).

- All elements after j in the subsequence are such that their consecutive differences are >= (nums[j] - nums[i]).

So, the number of such subsequences is:

(number of ways to choose elements before i, forming a subsequence with all consecutive differences >=d) * (number of ways to choose elements after j, forming a subsequence with all consecutive differences >=d) * (number of ways to choose elements between i and j, which is 0, since they are not allowed).

But since the elements between i and j are not allowed, the subsequence must consist of elements from the left of i, i, j, and elements to the right of j.

But the elements between i and j in the original array are not part of the subsequence.

So, the steps are:

For each pair (i, j) in the sorted array (i < j), compute d = nums[j] - nums[i].

The number of subsequences where the minimal difference is d is:

left_count * right_count * C, where:

left_count is the number of subsequences of the left part (elements before i) with length l, such that all consecutive differences are >=d.

right_count is the number of subsequences of the right part (elements after j) with length r, such that all consecutive differences are >=d.

The total number of elements in the subsequence is l + 2 + r =k.

So, for each pair (i,j), compute the number of ways to choose l elements from the left part (elements before i) and r elements from the right part (elements after j) such that l + r +2 =k, and the left and right subsequences have all consecutive differences >=d.

This is similar to the initial approach, but the pairs (i,j) are not necessarily consecutive in the original array.

But this approach would require considering all possible pairs (i,j) in the sorted array, not just consecutive pairs.

But this would be computationally expensive, as there are O(n^2) pairs. For n=50, this is 50*50=2500 pairs. For each pair, the left and right parts can be up to 50 elements each, leading to O(50^3) operations per pair, which is 2500 * 125,000 = 312,500,000 operations. This might be manageable, but it's a lot.

But perhaps this is the correct approach.

So, the steps are:

Sort the array.

For each pair (i,j) where i < j:

   d = nums[j] - nums[i]

   left_part = nums[0..i-1]

   right_part = nums[j+1..n-1]

   compute left_counts and right_counts for d.

   for l in 0 to len(left_part):

       for r in 0 to len(right_part):

           if l + r +2 ==k:

               total += left_counts[l] * right_counts[r] *d

So, this approach considers all possible pairs (i,j) in the sorted array, not just consecutive pairs.

But this would correctly count each subsequence exactly once, as the minimal difference is determined by the closest pair in the subsequence.

But how to verify this.

In the first example, the code would consider all pairs (i,j) where i < j.

For example, the pair (0,1) (d=1) contributes subsequences that include 0 and 1, and all other elements are from the left (empty) and right (elements after 1, which are 2,3,4). But the code would compute left_counts and right_counts for d=1.

But the code would also consider the pair (0,2) (d=2), which is the difference between 1 and 3. But in the subsequence [1,3], the minimal difference is 2. So, this pair would contribute 1*1*2=2. But in the example, the subsequence [1,3,4] has minimal difference 1 (3-4=1), so it's not counted for this pair.

But this approach would correctly count each subsequence once, based on its minimal difference.

But this approach is computationally expensive. For n=50, there are 50*49/2=1225 pairs. For each pair, the left and right parts can be up to 50 elements each. So, the code would take O(1225 * 50^3) = 1225 * 125,000 = 153,125,000 operations. Which is manageable in Python.

But the initial code only considered consecutive pairs, which is why it was wrong.

So, the correct approach is to consider all pairs (i,j) in the sorted array, not just consecutive pairs.

So, the code should be modified to iterate over all pairs (i,j) where i < j, not just consecutive pairs.

But this would require a lot of changes to the code.

So, the correct code would be:

Sort the array.

For each pair (i,j) where i < j:

   d = nums[j] - nums[i]

   left_part = nums[0..i-1]

   right_part = nums[j+1..n-1]

   compute left_counts and right_counts for d.

   for l in 0 to len(left_part):

       for r in 0 to len(right_part):

           if l + r +2 ==k:

               total += left_counts[l] * right_counts[r] *d

So, the code would iterate over all possible pairs (i,j), not just consecutive pairs.

But this would correctly count each subsequence once, based on its minimal difference.

But how to compute left_counts and right_counts for each pair (i,j).

The code for compute_counts remains the same.

But this approach would correctly handle cases where the minimal difference is not from consecutive pairs in the original array.

So, let's re-calculate the first example with this approach.

Example 1:

nums = [1,2,3,4], sorted.

All possible pairs (i,j) where i < j:

(0,1), d=1.

(0,2), d=2.

(0,3), d=3.

(1,2), d=1.

(1,3), d=2.

(2,3), d=1.

For each pair, compute left_part and right_part.

Pair (0,1), d=1:

left_part is empty. left_counts is [1].

right_part is [3,4]. right_counts for d=1 is [1,2,1].

Possible l=0, r=1: 0+1+2=3. contribution 1*2*1=2.

Pair (0,2), d=2:

left_part is empty. left_counts is [1].

right_part is [4]. right_counts for d=2 is [1,1].

Possible l=0, r=1: 0+1+2=3. contribution 1*1*2=2.

Pair (0,3), d=3:

left_part is empty. left_counts is [1].

right_part is empty. right_counts is [1].

Possible l=0, r=0: 0+0+2=2 <3. No contribution.

Pair (1,2), d=1:

left_part is [1]. left_counts for d=1:

m=1. For l=1: counts[1] =1.

right_part is [4]. right_counts for d=1: [1,1].

Possible l=0, r=1: 0+1+2=3. contribution 1*1*1=1.

l=1, r=0: 1+0+2=3. contribution 1*1*1=1.

Total contribution for this pair: 2.

Pair (1,3), d=2:

left_part is [1,2]. left_counts for d=2:

m=2.

For l=1: counts[1] =2.

For l=2:

pos=0: target=1-2= -1. j_max=-1. sum_prev=0. dp[0][2] =0.

pos=1: target=2-2=0. j_max=-1. sum_prev=0. dp[1][2] =0.

counts[2] =0.

So left_counts is [1,2,0].

right_part is empty. right_counts is [1].

Possible l=1, r=0: 1+0+2=3. contribution 2*1*2=4.

But l=1 is allowed. So contribution is 2*1*2=4.

But wait, the left_part is [1,2], and d=2. The left_counts for l=1 is 2 (subsequences [1], [2]). For r=0, the right_part is empty. So, the subsequence is [1,3], which has length 2. But k=3. So, this pair (1,3) can't contribute to k=3.

Wait, no. For pair (1,3), the subsequence must include 1 and 3. The left_part is [1,2], and the right_part is empty. So, the subsequence is formed by selecting elements from the left_part (before 1), which is empty, and elements from the right_part (after 3), which is empty. So, the subsequence is [1,3], which has length 2. But k=3. So, this pair can't contribute to k=3. So, the code would not count this.

But according to the code, for pair (1,3), l can be 0,1,2 (since left_part has length 2). r can be 0.

So, l + r +2 =3.

Possible l=1, r=0: 1+0+2=3. So, contribution is left_counts[1] * right_counts[0] *d =2 *1 *2=4.

But the subsequence would be [1,3] plus one element from the left_part. But the left_part is [1,2], and the code allows selecting l=1 elements from the left_part. But the left_part is before i=1 (which is the index of 2 in the original array). Wait, no. The pair (1,3) is indices 1 and 3 in the sorted array. So, the left_part is nums[0..0] (element 1), and the right_part is nums[4..3], which is empty.

Wait, no. The original array is [1,2,3,4]. The pair (1,3) is indices 1 and 3, which are elements 2 and 4. So, left_part is nums[0..0] (element 1), and right_part is nums[4..3], which is empty.

So, for pair (1,3), left_part is [1], right_part is empty.

So, left_counts for d=2 (4-2=2):

left_part is [1]. For l=1: counts[1] =1.

So, for l=1, r=0: 1+0+2=3. contribution 1*1*2=2.

But the subsequence would be [1,2,4], which has consecutive differences 1 and 2. The minimal difference is 1. So, this subsequence's minimal difference is 1, not 2. So, the code is counting it for pair (1,3) with d=2, but the minimal difference is 1. So, this is incorrect.

So, the code's approach is still wrong.

This suggests that the code's approach is not correct, even when considering all pairs.

So, what's the problem?

The problem is that when considering a pair (i,j) with d = nums[j] - nums[i], the code assumes that the minimal difference in the subsequence is d. But this is only true if there are no other pairs in the subsequence with a smaller difference.

But the code's approach allows elements from the left_part and right_part, which may have pairs with smaller differences.

For example, in the subsequence [1,2,4], the pair (0,1) has difference 1, which is smaller than d=2. So, the minimal difference is 1, not 2. But the code counts this subsequence for pair (1,3) with d=2, which is incorrect.

So, the code's approach is incorrect.

This indicates that the initial approach is fundamentally flawed. The code is counting subsequences where the pair (i,j) has difference d, and all other consecutive differences in the subsequence are >=d. But this is not sufficient to ensure that the minimal difference is d. Because there may be other pairs in the subsequence that have a smaller difference.

So, the code's approach is incorrect.

This is a major problem. So, what's the correct way to model this?

The correct approach must ensure that the minimal difference in the subsequence is exactly d, and that there are no other pairs in the subsequence with a smaller difference.

This seems very challenging.

Alternative idea: For each pair (i,j) in the sorted array, compute the number of subsequences that include i and j, and all elements in the subsequence are between i and j (inclusive), and the minimal difference in the subsequence is d = nums[j] - nums[i]. But this would require that there are no elements between i and j in the subsequence, and all elements in the subsequence are between i and j. But this is not possible, as the subsequence can have elements outside of i and j.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal difference in the subsequence is determined by the closest pair in the subsequence. So, for a subsequence S, the minimal difference is the minimal of all pairwise differences. But in a sorted array, this is the minimal of the consecutive differences in the subsequence.

So, the minimal difference is the minimal of the consecutive differences in the subsequence.

So, for a subsequence S of length k, the minimal difference is the minimal of S[i+1] - S[i] for all i in 0..k-2.

So, the sum is the sum over all possible subsequences of length k of the minimal of their consecutive differences.

To compute this sum efficiently, perhaps we can use dynamic programming to track the minimal difference for subsequences of
