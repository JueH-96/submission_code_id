Okay, let's see. The problem is to find for each string S_k the minimal cost to make it either empty or match one of the previous strings. The operations allowed are deleting the last character (cost 1) or adding any character to the end (cost 1). Hmm.

So for each k, we need to consider all possible options. The minimal cost would be the minimum between deleting all characters (cost equal to the length of S_k) or modifying S_k to become some S_j where j < k, and find the minimal cost for that.

Wait, but how do we efficiently compute the cost to turn S_k into S_j for j < k? Let's think. Let's say S_j is shorter than S_k. Then, maybe we can delete some characters from the end of S_k until we get a prefix that matches S_j, and then add the remaining characters. Or if S_j is longer, then perhaps we can delete some characters from S_k and then add the missing ones. Wait, no. Because adding can only append characters. So to make T match S_j, after possibly deleting some characters from the end of S_k, we can add characters to the end to reach S_j. But S_j could be longer or shorter than the modified T.

Wait, maybe the way to approach this is to find the longest possible prefix of S_j that matches a suffix of S_k. For example, suppose S_j is "abc". Then, for S_k, we can delete characters until the remaining string is a prefix of S_j. Wait, no. Wait, when you delete characters from the end of S_k, you are left with a prefix of S_k. Then, adding characters to the end can extend it to S_j. So for S_j to be a target, the S_k's prefix (after deletions) must be a prefix of S_j. Because adding can only append characters. Wait, no. Let's see. Suppose S_j is "abcd". If after deleting some characters from S_k, we have "abx", then even if we add 'cd', it becomes "abxcd", which doesn't match. So the only way for S_k (after deletions and additions) to equal S_j is that the remaining string after deletions is a prefix of S_j, and then we add the remaining characters. Wait, no. Wait, the process is: you can delete from the end of S_k (so the string becomes shorter, but the remaining is the first m characters for some m <= len(S_k)), and then add characters to the end. So the resulting string after deletions and additions must be exactly S_j. So the steps are:

1. Delete some characters from the end of S_k, resulting in a string T' which is a prefix of S_k (length m, where m ranges from 0 to len(S_k)).

2. Add characters to the end of T' to make it equal to S_j. The cost is (len(S_k) - m) (cost for deletions) + (len(S_j) - m) (cost for additions, since each added character is cost 1). But this is only possible if T' is a prefix of S_j. Otherwise, even after adding, you can't reach S_j.

Wait, no. Because adding allows adding any characters. So, for example, if T' is "ab", and S_j is "abc", then you can add 'c' to get "abc", which matches. But if S_j is "abd", then you can add 'd' instead. So the cost would be (len(S_k) - m) + (len(S_j) - m) if T' is a prefix of S_j. Wait, no. Because S_j can be any string. So the idea is that after deleting to get T' (length m), you can add characters to the end to form S_j. But for that to be possible, T' must be a prefix of S_j. Because the added characters have to exactly form the remaining part of S_j. Otherwise, even after adding, you can't reach S_j. For example, T' is "ab", and S_j is "abc": adding 'c' gives S_j. But if S_j is "abd", then you can add 'd' to get "abd". So T' must be a prefix of S_j. So the minimal cost for S_j is (len(S_k) - m) + (len(S_j) - m), where m is the length of the longest prefix of S_j that is a suffix of S_k (i.e., T' is the first m characters of S_j, and also the last m characters of S_k). Wait, no. Wait, T' is obtained by deleting the last (len(S_k) - m) characters of S_k, so T' is the first m characters of S_k. Then, to form S_j, T' must be a prefix of S_j, and then we add the remaining len(S_j) - m characters. So the cost is (len(S_k) - m) + (len(S_j) - m). But for this to be possible, the first m characters of S_k must equal the first m characters of S_j. Then, the added characters would be the rest of S_j. So the minimal cost for S_j is (len(S_k) - m) + (len(S_j) - m), where m is the maximum possible value such that the first m characters of S_j match the first m characters of S_k. Wait, no. Because S_j's first m characters must match the first m characters of S_k. Wait, no. Wait, S_k's first m characters (after deleting the end) is T', which is the first m characters of S_k. Then, to form S_j, T' must be a prefix of S_j. So m can be up to the minimum of len(S_k) and len(S_j). For example, if S_j is longer than S_k, then m can be up to len(S_k), but then len(S_j) - m is the number of characters to add. So the cost would be (len(S_k) - m) (deleting len(S_k) - m characters) + (len(S_j) - m) (adding len(S_j) - m characters). But for this to be possible, the first m characters of S_j must equal the first m characters of S_k. So for each S_j (j < k), we can compute the maximum m where S_j[0..m-1] == S_k[0..m-1], then the cost is (len(S_k) - m) + (len(S_j) - m). Then, for each k, we need to find the minimal cost among all j < k (including the option of deleting all characters, which is cost len(S_k)), and also the option of making T empty (cost len(S_k)).

Wait, but for the option of making T empty, that's just deleting all characters, which costs len(S_k). So for each k, the minimal cost is the minimum between len(S_k) (deleting all) and the minimal cost over all j < k of ( (len(S_k) - m) + (len(S_j) - m) ), where m is the maximum possible such that S_j starts with the first m characters of S_k. Wait, no. Wait, when you delete characters from S_k to get T' (length m), then T' must be a prefix of S_j. Because after adding, you can only append characters. So T' must be the first m characters of S_j, and then you add the remaining len(S_j) - m characters. So the maximum m is the length of the longest prefix of S_j that matches the first m characters of S_k. For example, if S_j is "abc", and S_k's first 2 characters are "ab", then m=2. Then the cost is (len(S_k) - 2) + (3 - 2) = len(S_k) -2 +1 = len(S_k) -1. But if S_j is longer than S_k, then m can be up to len(S_k), but S_j must start with the first m characters of S_k. For example, S_j is "abcd", S_k is "abx". Then m can be 2 (since S_j starts with "ab", which is the first two characters of S_k). Then cost is (3-2) + (4-2) = 1 +2=3. Then the resulting string would be "ab" (after deleting the last character of S_k) plus "cd" added, making "abcd", which is S_j. So that works.

So for each j < k, the cost to convert S_k to S_j is (len(S_k) - m) + (len(S_j) - m), where m is the length of the longest prefix of S_j that matches the first m characters of S_k. But how do we compute this m efficiently?

This seems like a problem that can be addressed with the use of the Z-algorithm or prefix function (KMP) for pattern matching. Because for each S_j, we need to find the maximum m where the first m characters of S_j match the first m characters of S_k. Alternatively, for each S_k, and for each j < k, compute the maximum m where S_j's prefix of length m matches S_k's prefix of length m.

But considering the constraints: N can be up to 2e5, and sum of |S_i| up to 2e5. So a naive approach where for each k, we check all j < k would be O(N^2), which is way too slow.

So we need a way to pre-process for all possible j < k, the maximum m where S_j is a prefix of S_k's prefix. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, for each S_j, we can precompute some data structure that allows us to quickly compute, given a string S_k, the maximum m where S_j's prefix of m characters matches S_k's prefix. Then, for each k, we can check all j < k and compute this m, but even that would be O(N) per k, which is 2e5 * 2e5 operations. Not feasible.

So we need a smarter approach. Let's think differently. For each k, the minimal cost is either len(S_k) (delete all) or the minimal ( (len(S_k) - m) + (len(S_j) - m) ) over j < k where m is the maximum possible for that j. Let's rewrite this as (len(S_k) + len(S_j) - 2m). To minimize this, we need to maximize m for each j. So for each j, the maximum possible m is the length of the longest prefix of S_j that matches the prefix of S_k. Then, for each j, compute this m, and calculate the cost. Then, among all j <k, find the minimal cost.

But how to compute this m for all j <k efficiently.

Another approach: For each k, the best j is one where S_j is a prefix of S_k, but perhaps longer than others. Wait, but S_j can be any of the previous strings. So perhaps for each k, the best j is the one with the longest possible prefix match with S_k. Then, the cost would be len(S_k) + len(S_j) - 2*m. So for each k, we need to find the j <k with the maximum (2m - len(S_j) - len(S_k)). Wait, no. Because the cost is (len(S_k) -m) + (len(S_j) -m) = len(S_k) + len(S_j) - 2m. To minimize this, we need to maximize (2m - len(S_j) - len(S_k)), but since len(S_k) and len(S_j) are fixed for a given j and k, for each j, the cost is len(S_k) + len(S_j) - 2m. So for a fixed k, the minimal cost is the minimum over j <k of (len(S_k) + len(S_j) - 2m_j), where m_j is the maximum m for j and k. And also compare with len(S_k) (the delete all option).

So the problem reduces to, for each k, compute min( len(S_k), min_{j<k} ( len(S_k) + len(S_j) - 2*m_j ) )

So the key is to find, for each k, the j <k that gives the maximum (2m_j - (len(S_j) + len(S_k)) ). Wait, because len(S_k) + len(S_j) - 2m_j is the cost, and we want to minimize that. So the minimal cost is the minimal of all possible (len(S_k) + len(S_j) - 2m_j) and len(S_k). So for each k, the minimal cost is the minimum between len(S_k) and the minimal value of (len(S_k) + len(S_j) - 2m_j) over j <k.

So how do we compute m_j for all j <k efficiently?

Alternative idea: For each j, precompute all possible prefixes and store them in a trie. Then, for S_k, we can traverse the trie to find the longest prefix of S_j that matches the beginning of S_k. But building a trie for all j <k would be expensive as k increases. Because for each new j, we have to add all its prefixes to the trie, but j can be up to 2e5, and each S_j can be up to 2e5 in total length. So the trie approach may not be feasible.

Alternative approach: For each j, compute the longest prefix of S_j, and for each possible position in S_j, store the hash. Then, for S_k, compute the hash for each prefix and check if it exists in any of the j's hash sets, up to their maximum possible m. But again, for each k, checking all j's is O(N), which is too slow.

Wait, but perhaps for each j, we can store the prefix hashes of S_j, and for S_k, compute the maximum m such that the first m characters of S_j equal the first m of S_k. Then, for each j, the maximum m is the maximum value where the hash of S_j's first m characters equals the hash of S_k's first m characters. To find this m for all j <k, but how?

Alternatively, for each j, compute the prefix function (KMP's failure function) for S_j, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, here's another idea: For each j, the maximum m where S_j's first m characters equal S_k's first m characters is the maximum m such that S_j[0..m-1] == S_k[0..m-1]. So for each j, this is equivalent to finding the longest prefix of S_j that matches the prefix of S_k. So for each j, this is the same as the length of the longest prefix of S_j which is a prefix of S_k.

So for all j <k, we need to compute this m_j for S_j and S_k. Then, for each k, find the minimal cost.

But computing this for all j <k is O(N) per k, which is O(N^2) total. Not feasible.

So we need a way to compute, for each S_k, the j <k which gives the maximum (2m_j - (len(S_j) + len(S_k)) ), but in a way that's O(1) or O(len(S_k)) per k.

Hmm. Let's think about the problem in terms of the maximum m_j. For a given S_k, the j that gives the maximum m_j is the one where S_j is the longest possible prefix of S_k. For example, if there is a j where S_j is exactly the first m characters of S_k, then m_j is m. So perhaps the best j for S_k is the one with the longest possible prefix match.

But how to find that j quickly.

Another approach: For each possible m (from 1 to len(S_k)), find the minimal len(S_j) - m for j <k where S_j has a prefix of length m that matches S_k's first m characters. Then, the cost for that m is (len(S_k) -m) + (len(S_j) - m) = len(S_k) + len(S_j) - 2m. So for each m, we need the minimal len(S_j) - m. Then, for each m, compute len(S_k) + (min_len_j(m) ) - m. Then, the minimal cost is the minimum over all m of this value, and also compare with len(S_k).

But how to compute min_len_j(m) for each m.

Alternatively, for each possible m, we can track the minimal len(S_j) among all j <k where S_j has a prefix of m characters that matches the first m characters of S_k.

But how to do that.

Wait, for each k, the first m characters of S_k are a string T. We need to find all j <k where S_j starts with T (for some m), and among those j, find the one with the smallest len(S_j) - m. Because the cost is len(S_k) + len(S_j) - 2m = (len(S_k) -m) + (len(S_j) -m). So for each m, we need the minimal (len(S_j) -m) among j's that have S_j starting with T (the first m chars of S_k). Then, the minimal cost for m is (len(S_k) -m) + (minimal (len(S_j) -m)).

So for each k, we can iterate over all possible m (from 0 up to len(S_k)), compute T = S_k[0..m-1], find the minimal (len(S_j) -m) among j <k where S_j starts with T. Then, the minimal cost for this m is (len(S_k) -m) + (minimal (len(S_j) -m)). The overall minimal cost for k is the minimum between len(S_k) and the minimal of all these values for m in 0..len(S_k).

But even this approach is O(len(S_k)) per k, which is O(2e5) per test case, but with N=2e5, that's O(4e10) operations. Which is way too slow.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: For each j, precompute all possible m (prefix lengths) and store in a hash map where the key is the prefix string, and the value is the minimal len(S_j) - m for that prefix. Then, for S_k, for each possible m (from 0 to len(S_k)), compute the prefix T = S_k[0..m-1], look up in the hash map the minimal len(S_j) - m for that T, and then compute the cost. Then, the minimal cost is the minimum of all these possibilities plus the len(S_k) option.

But the problem is that for each j, we would have to store all possible prefixes of S_j. For example, if S_j is length L, then there are L prefixes. So for all j, the total number of prefixes is sum_{j} |S_j|, which is 2e5. So the hash map can be built with O(2e5) entries, but each entry is a prefix string. However, storing all these prefixes would require a lot of memory. For example, if each prefix is stored as a string, then for 2e5 prefixes each of average length 100, that's 2e7 characters, which may be manageable. But the problem is that for each S_k, we need to check all possible m (prefixes of S_k) and look up in the hash map for each m. For example, if S_k is length L, then we have L+1 prefixes (including m=0, which is the empty string). For each m, we check the hash map for T = S_k[0..m-1], and get the minimal len(S_j) - m. Then, compute the cost for each m and take the minimum.

But how to compute the minimal len(S_j) - m for each T. For each T (prefix string), we can track the minimal value of (len(S_j) - m), where m is the length of T (since T is the prefix of S_j of length m). So for each T, we store the minimal (len(S_j) - m) across all j that have T as a prefix of their own S_j.

Wait, but when j has T as a prefix of length m, then T is the first m characters of S_j. So for each j, and for each m in 1..len(S_j), we can add the prefix T = S_j[0..m-1] to the hash map, and for that T, we track the minimal (len(S_j) - m). For example, if S_j is "abc", then for m=1, T is "a", and len(S_j) -m is 3-1=2. For m=2, T is "ab", len(S_j)-m=1. For m=3, T is "abc", len(S_j)-m=0. So for each T, we need to keep the minimal (len(S_j) -m) across all j and m where T is a prefix of S_j of length m.

But how to compute this for all possible T.

Wait, but for a given j, the minimal (len(S_j) -m) for all m where T is a prefix of S_j of length m is equal to len(S_j) - len(T). Because for T of length m, len(S_j) -m is the value. So for each j, for each of its prefixes T (all possible m), we can compute len(S_j) - m. For each T, we want to track the minimal such value across all j that have T as a prefix. So for example, if two different j's have the same T, then for each, we compute len(S_j) - m (m is len(T)), and take the minimal.

So for each T, we can store the minimal (len(S_j) - m), where m is the length of T, and j is any of the previous strings (j <k) that have T as a prefix of their own S_j.

So the approach would be:

1. For each j from 1 to N:

   a. For each possible m in 1 to len(S_j):

      i. T = S_j[0..m-1]

      ii. Compute value = len(S_j) - m

      iii. If T is not in the hash map, add it with this value.

      iv. Else, if the current value in the hash map is larger than this value, update it to the minimum.

   b. Also, for m=0 (empty string), which corresponds to the case where we delete all characters of S_k and then add the entire S_j. But wait, when m=0, the cost is (len(S_k) -0) + (len(S_j) -0) = len(S_k) + len(S_j). But that's worse than just deleting all (cost len(S_k)), unless len(S_j) is 0. But since S_j has at least length 1, this is not useful. So perhaps m=0 can be ignored.

But wait, when m=0, T is the empty string. So any S_j would have the empty string as a prefix. So for m=0, the value is len(S_j) -0 = len(S_j). So the minimal value for T empty string would be the minimal len(S_j) among all j <k. So the cost for m=0 would be len(S_k) + (minimal len(S_j)). But since len(S_j) is at least 1, this cost is len(S_k) +1, which is worse than deleting all (cost len(S_k)). So the minimal cost for m=0 is len(S_k) +1, which is worse than the delete all option. So perhaps we can ignore m=0.

But perhaps not. Let's see. For example, if S_j is empty, but according to the problem statement, each S_j has length at least 1. So m=0 is not useful. So perhaps we can ignore m=0.

So for each j, we process all m from 1 to len(S_j). For each T = S_j[0..m-1], we update the hash map to track the minimal (len(S_j) -m) for T.

Then, for each k, when processing S_k, we need to consider:

- The option of deleting all: cost len(S_k).

- For each m from 1 to len(S_k):

   T = S_k[0..m-1]

   If T is in the hash map, then the minimal (len(S_j) -m) for this T is stored. The cost for this m is (len(S_k) -m) + (minimal (len(S_j) -m)).

   So for each m, compute this cost, and take the minimal over all m.

The minimal between all these m's costs and len(S_k) is the answer for k.

But how to compute this for S_k efficiently.

The problem is that for S_k of length L, there are L possible m's (1 to L). For each m, we need to check if T is in the hash map, and then compute the cost.

But if L is up to 2e5, and N is up to 2e5, then total operations would be O( (2e5)^2 ), which is 4e10. That's way too slow.

So this approach is not feasible. We need a way to find the optimal m for S_k quickly.

Alternative idea: For each S_k, the optimal m is the maximum possible m such that T = S_k[0..m-1] exists in the hash map, and the corresponding minimal (len(S_j) -m) is as small as possible.

But how to find this m efficiently.

Wait, the cost for a given m is (len(S_k) -m) + (min_val), where min_val is the minimal (len(S_j) -m) for T. So for each m, the cost is (len(S_k) + min_val) - 2m. To minimize this, since len(S_k) is fixed, we need to maximize (2m - min_val). So the larger m is, the better, provided that min_val is not too large.

But how to find the m that maximizes (2m - min_val) for T in the hash map.

But this seems tricky. Perhaps the optimal m is the maximum possible m where T is present in the hash map, and the min_val for that T is as small as possible.

But even that is not clear.

Another angle: For each possible T, the minimal (len(S_j) - m) is stored. So for a given T, when we have S_k's prefix of length m (same as T's length), the cost is (len(S_k) -m) + min_val. So for each T that is a prefix of S_k, we can compute this cost and track the minimal.

But again, for S_k of length L, there are L possible T's to check.

Alternative idea: For each j, when adding its prefixes to the hash map, for each T (prefix of S_j), we can track the minimal (len(S_j) - m) for that T. Then, for S_k, the best possible m is the maximum possible m where T is a prefix of S_k, and the minimal (len(S_j) - m) for that T is as small as possible.

But how to find this m.

Wait, perhaps for S_k, the best m is the maximum possible m such that T is present in the hash map, and the corresponding (len(S_j) -m) is minimal. So for each possible m in S_k's prefixes, we can compute the cost and track the minimum.

But even this requires checking all possible m's for S_k.

Alternative approach inspired by the Z-algorithm:

The Z-array for a string S is an array Z where Z[i] is the length of the longest substring starting at i that matches the prefix of S. For example, Z[0] is the entire length of S. For i>0, Z[i] is the maximum length l such that S[0..l-1] = S[i..i+l-1].

But how does this help here? Well, perhaps for each j <k, we can compute the maximum m where the prefix of S_j matches the prefix of S_k. This is equivalent to finding the maximum m such that S_j[0..m-1] == S_k[0..m-1]. So for each j <k, this is the same as the Z-array of S_k, but looking for occurrences of S_j's prefixes.

Alternatively, for each j, compute the maximum m where S_j's prefix of length m matches S_k's prefix of length m. This can be done by comparing the two prefixes.

But again, doing this for all j <k is O(N^2), which is not feasible.

Alternative idea inspired by suffix automaton:

Build a suffix automaton for all the previous strings. For each new S_k, find the longest prefix of S_k that matches any of the previous strings. Then, for that j, compute the cost.

But I'm not sure how to do this.

Alternatively, for each j, precompute a trie of all prefixes of S_j. Then, for S_k, traverse the trie to find the longest prefix of S_k that matches any of the prefixes in the trie. For each node in the trie, we can track the minimal (len(S_j) -m) for that prefix.

But building a trie for all j <k as we process each k would be manageable. Let's think:

We can build a trie incrementally. For each j in 1..N, after processing j, we add all prefixes of S_j to the trie, and for each node (which represents a prefix), we track the minimal (len(S_j) -m) where m is the length of the prefix (since m is the length of the prefix, len(S_j) -m is the value stored).

Then, for each k, when processing S_k, we traverse the trie along the characters of S_k, and for each step (each m), we can get the minimal (len(S_j) -m) stored in that trie node. Then, for each m (from 1 to len(S_k)), we can compute the cost as (len(S_k) -m) + min_val. The minimal cost over all m is the answer.

But how to build such a trie and track the minimal (len(S_j) -m) for each prefix.

Let's think about the trie structure. Each node represents a prefix. The root is the empty string. Each edge represents a character. For each node (prefix of length m), we track the minimal (len(S_j) -m) across all j that have this prefix.

So when adding a new string S_j, for each m from 1 to len(S_j), we insert the prefix S_j[0..m-1] into the trie. For each node (prefix) encountered, we compare the current minimal value stored in the node. If the new (len(S_j) -m) is smaller than the existing value, we update it.

This way, for each prefix T, the trie node stores the minimal (len(S_j) -m) across all j processed so far.

Then, for S_k, when we process it, we traverse the trie character by character. At each step m (processing the m-th character of S_k), we check if the current node has a minimal value. If yes, then the cost for this m is (len(S_k) -m) + min_val. We can track the minimal cost over all m.

This approach would have O(L) time per k, where L is the length of S_k, since we process each character once while traversing the trie. The trie insertion for each j is O(len(S_j)), and since we process all j up to N, the total time is O(sum len(S_j)), which is acceptable.

Yes! This seems feasible.

So the steps are:

1. Initialize a trie structure where each node has a dictionary of children (char to node), and a value 'min_val' which is the minimal (len(S_j) -m) for the prefix represented by the node.

2. For each j from 1 to N:

   a. Insert all prefixes of S_j into the trie. For each m from 1 to len(S_j):

      i. The prefix is S_j[0..m-1].

      ii. Traverse the trie from the root, following the characters of the prefix.

      iii. For each node along the path (including the node after inserting the entire prefix), update the 'min_val' to be the minimum between the current 'min_val' and (len(S_j) -m). Because for this prefix of length m, the value is len(S_j) -m, and we want to track the minimal such value for each prefix.

   b. After inserting all prefixes of S_j, proceed to the next j.

3. For each k from 1 to N:

   a. Compute the cost of deleting all characters: cost_delete = len(S_k).

   b. Traverse the trie with S_k's characters, keeping track of the current node and the current m (length of the prefix so far).

   c. For each step in the traversal (each m from 1 to len(S_k)):

      i. If the current node exists (i.e., the prefix is present in the trie), then compute the cost for this m: cost = (len(S_k) - m) + current_node.min_val.

      ii. Keep track of the minimal cost encountered during this traversal.

   d. The answer for k is the minimum between cost_delete and the minimal cost found in step c.

But wait, when inserting the prefixes of S_j into the trie, for each m, we have to insert the prefix S_j[0..m-1], and for each node along the path (each prefix of S_j), update the min_val. For example, when inserting S_j = "abc", m=1: prefix is "a", update the node for "a" with (3 -1) =2. Then m=2: prefix "ab", update node "ab" with (3-2)=1. Then m=3: prefix "abc", update node "abc" with (3-3)=0. So for each node in the trie that represents a prefix of S_j, we track the minimal (len(S_j) -m) across all j's that have this prefix.

So when inserting S_j, for each of its prefixes, we update the min_val in the trie nodes.

Then, for S_k, when we traverse the trie character by character, at each step m (the length of the current prefix), if the current node exists, then the min_val is the minimal (len(S_j) -m) for that prefix. So the cost for this m is (len(S_k) -m) + min_val.

The minimal cost over all m (including all possible prefixes of S_k) and the delete option is the answer.

This approach would be O(sum len(S_j)) for inserting all prefixes into the trie, and O(sum len(S_k)) for processing all S_k. Since sum len(S_j) is up to 2e5, and sum len(S_k) is also up to 2e5, this should be manageable.

Now, the challenge is to implement the trie efficiently.

But how to represent the trie nodes. Each node can have a dictionary of children (char to node). Also, each node has a min_val. Initially, the root node's min_val is infinity, and as we insert prefixes, we update the min_val for each node along the path.

So for inserting a prefix T of length m for S_j:

current_node = root

for each character in T:

   if character not in current_node's children:

       create a new node with empty children and min_val = infinity

   current_node = current_node's children[character]

   current_node.min_val = min(current_node.min_val, len(S_j) - m)

Wait, no. Because for each prefix of T (which is S_j's prefix of length 1, 2, ..., m), we need to update the min_val for each node along the path. For example, when inserting the prefix "abc" (m=3), we need to update the nodes for "a", "ab", and "abc".

But the code above only updates the nodes for the full length of T. That's incorrect.

Wait, no. Because when inserting the prefix T of length m, which is S_j[0..m-1], we need to process each character in T, and for each step (each character), update the min_val for the current node (which represents the prefix up to that character). So for example, inserting "abc" (m=3):

- After first character 'a', the node for 'a' is updated with len(S_j) -1 =3-1=2.

- Then 'b' is added, node 'ab' is updated with len(S_j) -2=1.

- Then 'c' is added, node 'abc' is updated with len(S_j)-3=0.

So during the insertion of the prefix T of length m, we need to process each character in T, and for each step (after adding each character), update the current node's min_val.

So the code for inserting a prefix T (of length m) would be:

current_node = root

for i in 0 to m-1:

   char = T[i]

   if char not in current_node's children:

       create new node with empty children and min_val = infinity

   current_node = current_node's children[char]

   current_node.min_val = min(current_node.min_val, len(S_j) - (i+1))

Because for each step i (0-based), the length of the prefix is i+1. So len(S_j) - (i+1) is the value to compare.

So for each prefix T of S_j (of any length m), inserting into the trie involves processing each character and updating the min_val for each node along the path.

This way, when inserting S_j, all of its prefixes are added to the trie, and each node's min_val is the minimal (len(S_j) - m) across all j's that have this prefix.

Once the trie is built, for each S_k, we can traverse the trie character by character, and for each step (each m), check if the current node exists. If it does, compute the cost (len(S_k) - m) + current_node.min_val, and keep track of the minimal cost.

The minimal cost for S_k is the minimum between len(S_k) and the minimal cost found during the traversal.

So this approach should work.

Now, let's test this logic against the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

3

snuke

snuki

snuuk

Sample Output 1:

5

2

4

For k=1 (S_1 is "snuke"):

The trie is empty. So during processing k=1, the trie has no nodes. So the only option is to delete all, cost 5.

For k=2 (S_2 is "snuki"):

We need to insert all prefixes of S_2 into the trie (for j=2, but j=2 is processed after k=2? Wait, no. Wait, j runs from 1 to N, and for each j, we insert its prefixes into the trie. Then, when processing k=2, the trie contains the prefixes of j=1.

Wait, no. The processing order is:

For j from 1 to N:

   insert all prefixes of S_j into the trie.

Then, for k from 1 to N:

   process S_k.

Wait, no. Because j runs from 1 to N, and after inserting all j's prefixes into the trie, when processing k=1, the trie contains all j's up to j=1. Then, when processing k=2, the trie contains j=1 and j=2's prefixes. Wait, no. Because j runs from 1 to N, and for each j, we insert its prefixes into the trie. So when j=1 is processed, the trie contains its prefixes. Then j=2 is processed, and its prefixes are added. So when k=2 is processed (the second step), the trie contains j=1 and j=2's prefixes.

Wait, no. The code would process j from 1 to N, inserting their prefixes into the trie. Then, for each k from 1 to N, process S_k. But the code is supposed to process each k in order, but the j's are processed first. Wait, no. The code would process j from 1 to N, and for each j, insert their prefixes into the trie. Then, for each k from 1 to N, compute the answer based on the trie (which includes all j <k, since j runs up to k-1).

Wait, no. Because j runs from 1 to N, and for each j, we insert their prefixes into the trie. Then, when processing k, the trie includes all j's up to j=k. But for k, we need to consider j <k. So this approach would include j=k in the trie when processing k, which is incorrect.

Ah, here's a mistake in the approach. Because when we process j from 1 to N, inserting all their prefixes into the trie, then for k=1, the trie contains j=1's prefixes. But when processing k=2, the trie contains j=1 and j=2's prefixes, but j=2 is not less than k=2 (since k=2 is j=2). So this is incorrect.

The problem is that for k, we should consider j <k, but the current approach includes j=k in the trie when processing k. So this is wrong.

So the correct approach is to process j from 1 to N, and for each j, after inserting their prefixes into the trie, process k=j+1. But no, because k must be processed in order. So the code must insert the prefixes of j into the trie, and then when processing k=j, the trie includes j's prefixes. But j must be less than k.

Wait, no. For each k, the j's that are allowed are j <k. So when processing k, the trie must contain all j <k's prefixes. So the code must process j from 1 to k-1, insert their prefixes into the trie, then process k. But this would require inserting the prefixes of j=1, then j=2, etc., and for each k, the trie contains j=1..k-1.

But how to do this in code.

Ah, the code should process j from 1 to N, and for each j, after inserting their prefixes into the trie, process k=j. But no, because j is processed first, then k is processed. Wait, no. The code should:

Initialize the trie as empty.

For each j in 1..N:

   insert all prefixes of S_j into the trie.

   compute the answer for k=j.

But wait, no. Because when inserting j's prefixes into the trie, those j's are the ones that can be used for k=j. But j must be <k. So for k=j, j is not less than k. So this is incorrect.

So the correct approach is to process j from 1 to N, and for each j, insert their prefixes into the trie after processing k=j. Because when processing k=j, the trie contains j' <j's prefixes.

So the code should be:

Initialize the trie as empty.

For each k in 1..N:

   compute the answer for S_k using the current trie (which contains j <k's prefixes).

   insert all prefixes of S_k into the trie.

This way, when processing k, the trie contains j <k's prefixes, and after processing k, we add S_k's prefixes to the trie for future k's.

Yes! This is the correct approach.

So the steps are:

For each k from 1 to N:

   1. Compute the answer for S_k:

      a. The cost is min( len(S_k), min over m of (len(S_k) -m) + trie_node.min_val )

   2. Insert all prefixes of S_k into the trie, updating the min_val for each node.

So during processing k, the trie contains all j <k's prefixes. After processing k, the trie is updated with S_k's prefixes for future k's.

This way, when processing k=2, the trie contains j=1's prefixes. When processing k=3, the trie contains j=1 and j=2's prefixes.

So the code should process k in order, and for each k, first compute the answer using the current trie (which has j <k's prefixes), then insert S_k's prefixes into the trie.

This is the correct order.

Now, let's re-examine the sample input 1:

Sample Input 1:

3

snuke

snuki

snuuk

Processing k=1:

Trie is empty. So the answer is len(S_1) =5.

Then, insert all prefixes of S_1 ("snuke") into the trie.

For each prefix:

m=1: 's' → min_val =5-1=4.

m=2: 'sn' → min_val=5-2=3.

m=3: 'snu' → min_val=5-3=2.

m=4: 'snuke' → min_val=5-4=1.

Processing k=2 (S_2 is "snuki"):

The trie contains j=1's prefixes. So when traversing S_2's characters:

s → node 's' exists. min_val is 4. cost is (6-1) +4 =5+4=9? Wait, len(S_2) is 5. Wait, S_2 is "snuki", which has length 5.

So len(S_k) is 5.

Traversing S_2's characters:

m=1: 's' → node exists. min_val=4. cost = (5-1) +4=4+4=8.

m=2: 'sn' → node exists. min_val=3. cost = (5-2) +3=3+3=6.

m=3: 'snu' → node exists. min_val=2. cost =5-3 +2=2+2=4.

m=4: 'snuk' → node not in trie (since j=1's prefixes are up to 'snuke').

m=5: 'snuki' → node not in trie.

So the minimal cost from the trie is 4. But also compare with deleting all (5). So the answer is min(5,4) =4. But according to the sample output, the answer for k=2 is 2.

Wait, this indicates a problem. Because according to the sample input 1, the answer for k=2 is 2.

Wait, what's the correct answer for k=2?

Sample Input 1:

k=2 is "snuki". The correct answer is 2.

According to the sample explanation: delete the last character (cost 1), then add 'e' (cost 1). Total cost 2.

So the resulting string is "snuke", which is S_1.

So for k=2, the cost is 2.

But according to the trie approach:

When processing k=2, the trie contains j=1's prefixes. So when we traverse S_2's characters:

S_2 is "snuki".

Traversing:

m=1: 's' → node exists. min_val=4 (from j=1's len(S_j) -1 =5-1=4). So cost is (5-1) +4=4+4=8.

m=2: 'sn' → node exists. min_val=3 (5-2=3). cost is (5-2)+3=3+3=6.

m=3: 'snu' → node exists. min_val=2 (5-3=2). cost is (5-3)+2=2+2=4.

m=4: 'snuk' → not in trie.

m=5: 'snuki' → not in trie.

So the minimal cost from the trie is 4. But the sample answer is 2.

This indicates a discrepancy. So the approach is wrong.

What's wrong here?

Ah, I see the mistake. The trie for j=1 contains the prefixes of S_1, which is "snuke". So the prefixes are:

m=1: 's' → min_val=5-1=4.

m=2: 'sn' → min_val=3.

m=3: 'snu' → min_val=2.

m=4: 'snuke' → min_val=1.

But when processing k=2, S_2 is "snuki". So the first three characters are 's', 'n', 'u' → which matches the first three characters of S_1's prefixes. But S_2's fourth character is 'k', while S_1's fourth character is 'k' (since S_1 is "snuke"). Wait, no. S_1 is "snuke", which is s-n-u-k-e. So the first three characters are s-n-u. S_2's first three are s-n-u. Then, the fourth character of S_2 is 'k' (since S_2 is "snuki": s-n-u-k-i).

So when processing k=2, the trie for j=1 has a node for 'snu' (m=3). So when processing S_2's first three characters, we reach the 'snu' node. The min_val is 2 (from j=1's len(S_j) -3 =5-3=2). So the cost for m=3 is (5-3) +2=2+2=4. But the sample answer is 2.

So why is this discrepancy?

Because the sample answer is achieved by deleting the last character of S_2 (cost 1), resulting in "snuk", then adding 'e' (cost 1). So the total cost is 2.

But according to our approach, the minimal cost is 4. So why is this the case?

Ah, because the approach is considering the option of matching S_j (j=1) by adding characters. But in this case, the j=1's string is "snuke", which is longer than the current T' (after deletion of one character, which is "snuk"). So the cost would be (5-4) + (5-4) =1+1=2. But how is this captured in our approach?

Because in our approach, when processing k=2, we are inserting all j <k's prefixes into the trie. j=1 is <k=2, so its prefixes are in the trie. So for S_2's prefix of length 4 ("snuk"), is this present in the trie?

Yes. Because j=1's S_1 is "snuke", which has a prefix of length 4 ("snuke"). So the trie has a node for "snuke" (m=4), but not for "snuk" (m=4 of S_2). So when processing S_2's prefix of m=4 ("snuk"), it's not present in the trie. So the code would not consider this.

But in reality, the optimal path for k=2 is to delete the last character (cost 1), resulting in "snuk", then add 'e' (cost 1). But "snuk" is not a prefix of any S_j (j <k=2). So how is this captured?

Ah, because "snuk" is not a prefix of any S_j (j <k=2). So the code's approach would not consider this option. So why is the sample answer possible?

Because the code's approach is not considering all possible j's. Wait, no. Because j=1's S_1 is "snuke". So "snuke" is a prefix of S_j=1. But "snuk" is not a prefix of S_j=1. So when the code processes S_2, the only j considered is j=1. But in the sample explanation, the solution is to make T match S_1 by deleting the last character and adding 'e'. So the T after deletion is "snuk", which is not a prefix of S_1. So how does this work?

Ah, because the code's approach is incorrect. Because the code's approach assumes that to match S_j, the prefix of S_k after deletion must be a prefix of S_j. But in reality, after deletion, the remaining string is a prefix of S_k. Then, you can add characters to the end to make it S_j. So the prefix of S_k after deletion must be a prefix of S_j. But in the sample case, after deleting one character from S_2 ("snuki" becomes "snuk"), which is not a prefix of S_1 ("snuke"). So this approach is not captured in the code's logic.

Wait, but the sample explanation says that after deleting the last character of T (S_2 is "snuki"), you get "snuk", then add 'e' to get "snuke", which is S_1. But how is this possible? Because "snuk" is not a prefix of S_1. So the code's approach is not considering this possibility.

So there's a flaw in the approach. The code's current logic only considers the case where the prefix of S_k after deletion is a prefix of S_j, but the sample case requires that the prefix after deletion is not a prefix of S_j, but after adding characters, the resulting string is S_j.

So the initial approach is incorrect.

This means that the initial approach is missing some cases. So the logic is wrong.

Hmm. So what's wrong with the initial approach?

The initial approach assumes that to make T match S_j, you need to delete characters to get a prefix of S_k, then add characters to reach S_j. But in the sample case, after deleting characters, the resulting string is not a prefix of S_j, but after adding characters, it becomes S_j. So the initial approach is missing this case.

So the initial approach is incorrect. Therefore, the entire logic is flawed.

This is a critical mistake. So we need to rethink the problem.

Let me re-express the problem:

We can perform any number of delete and add operations. The goal is to make T either empty or equal to one of the previous S_j.

The operations are:

1. Delete the last character (cost 1). Can be done any number of times.

2. Add any character to the end (cost 1). Can be done any number of times.

So for S_k, we can delete some characters from the end (say, d characters), resulting in a string T' of length m = len(S_k) -d. Then, we can add some characters (a characters) to T', resulting in a string of length m +a. This must be equal to S_j for some j <k, or empty.

The cost is d +a.

We need to find the minimal cost over all possible j <k and possible d and a.

So the minimal cost is the minimum between:

a) len(S_k) (delete all, cost len(S_k)).

b) For some j <k, the minimal cost d +a where:

   T' = S_k[0..m-1] (m = len(S_k) -d)

   T' + added_chars = S_j.

   So added_chars is S_j[m..len(S_j)-1], which requires that S_j starts with T' (i.e., T' is a prefix of S_j), and then a = len(S_j) -m.

   So cost is d + (len(S_j) -m) = (len(S_k) -m) + (len(S_j) -m) = len(S_k) + len(S_j) - 2m.

So the initial approach was correct for this case.

But in the sample input 1, for k=2, the optimal solution is to delete one character (d=1), resulting in T' = "snuk" (m=4). Then add 'e' (a=1), so total cost 2. But this requires that T' is a prefix of S_j for some j <k. However, S_j for j=1 is "snuke", which is "s n u k e". T' is "s n u k". So T' is not a prefix of S_j. So the cost for j=1 would require that T' is a prefix of S_j. But since it's not, this case is not considered in the initial approach.

But the sample solution says that after adding 'e', the string becomes S_j. So how is this possible?

Ah, because after deleting d=1 characters, T' is "snuk", and then adding 'e' gives "snuke", which is S_j=1. So T' + 'e' = S_j. But T' is not a prefix of S_j. So this case is not captured by the initial approach.

So the initial approach is incorrect.

This indicates that the initial approach is missing cases where T' is not a prefix of S_j, but T' + some added characters equals S_j.

So the initial approach is wrong.

So what's the correct way to model this?

The problem requires that after deleting d characters and adding a characters, the resulting string equals S_j. So the resulting string is exactly S_j. So the way to model this is:

T' (after deletion) must be a prefix of S_j, and the added characters must be the remaining part of S_j.

So T' must be a prefix of S_j, and the added characters must be the part of S_j that comes after T'.

But in the sample case, T' is "snuk", which is not a prefix of S_j=1 ("snuke"). So how does this work?

Ah, because the sample explanation is incorrect? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, no. Let's look at the sample input 1:

Sample Input 1:

3

snuke

snuki

snuuk

For k=2, the string is "snuki".

Sample output is 2. Explanation: delete the last character (cost 1) to get "snuk", then add 'e' (cost 1) to get "snuke", which is S_1.

But "snuk" + 'e' is "snuke", which is S_1. But "snuk" is not a prefix of S_1. So how is this possible?

Ah, because the added characters are not required to be the remaining part of S_j. Wait, no. Because the added characters can be any characters. So after deleting d characters, the T' is "snuk". Then, adding 'e' gives "snuke", which is S_j=1. So T' is "snuk", and the added characters are 'e', which is the fifth character of S_j=1. But T' is not a prefix of S_j=1. So this case is not captured by the initial approach.

So the initial approach is incorrect because it assumes that T' must be a prefix of S_j. But in reality, T' can be any string, and the added characters can be any characters to form S_j. So the initial approach is missing these cases.

So the problem is more general than previously thought.

So the correct approach must consider all possible ways to delete some characters from the end of S_k and add some characters to get S_j. This includes cases where T' (the string after deletion) is not a prefix of S_j.

But how to model this efficiently.

The cost for a particular j is:

d + a = (len(S_k) -m) + a, where m is the length after deletion (m = len(S_k) -d), and a is the number of characters added. The resulting string is T' + added_chars = S_j. So T' must be a prefix of S_j of length m, and the added_chars must be the remaining len(S_j) -m characters of S_j.

But wait, no. Because T' can be any string, and the added_chars can be any characters. So T' + added_chars must equal S_j. So T' can be any string, and added_chars is S_j[len(T'):], but only if T' is a prefix of S_j. Otherwise, it's impossible.

Wait, no. Because if T' is not a prefix of S_j, then there's no way that T' + added_chars can equal S_j. Because S_j is a fixed string. For example, if T' is "abc" and S_j is "abd", then even if you add 'd', you get "abcd", which is longer than S_j. So the only way T' + added_chars equals S_j is if T' is a prefix of S_j, and the added_chars is the remaining part of S_j.

So the initial approach was correct. But the sample explanation seems to contradict this.

But according to the sample explanation for k=2, the solution is to delete one character (d=1) to get "snuk", then add 'e' to get "snuke". But "snuk" is not a prefix of S_j=1 ("snuke"). So this would require that T' is "snuk" and added_chars is 'e', but "snuk" + 'e' is "snuke", which is S_j=1. But "snuk" is not a prefix of S_j=1. So this is impossible.

But according to the sample explanation, this is possible. So there must be a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, let's re-examine S_j=1. S_1 is "snuke". So the entire string is "s n u k e".

If T' is "s n u k" (length 4), then adding 'e' gives "snuke", which matches S_j=1. So T' is "s n u k", which is the first 4 characters of S_j=1. So T' is a prefix of S_j=1. So why is this not captured in the initial approach?

Ah, because S_2 is "snuki". When we delete one character (d=1), we get "snuki" without the last character, which is "snuk". But S_1's first four characters are "s n u k", which is "snuke"[:4] = "snuke"[:4] is "s n u k". So T' is "snuk", which is a prefix of S_j=1's first four characters. So in this case, T' is a prefix of S_j=1.

But according to the initial approach, when processing k=2, the trie contains j=1's prefixes. So when processing S_2's prefix of length 4 ("snuk"), is this present in the trie?

Yes. Because j=1's S_1 is "snuke", which has a prefix of length 4: "snuke"[:4] is "s n u k". So when j=1 is processed, all prefixes are added to the trie. So the trie has a node for "s n u k" (m=4), with min_val = len(S_j) -m =5-4=1.

So when processing k=2's prefix of m=4 ("snuk"), which is the same as j=1's prefix of m=4, the trie node exists, and the min_val is 1.

So the cost for m=4 would be (5-4) +1=1+1=2. Which is the correct answer.

Ah, so the initial approach is correct. The mistake in the previous analysis was that S_2's prefix of m=4 is "snuk", which is the same as j=1's prefix of m=4. So during processing k=2, the code would traverse the trie and find this node.

So why was the previous analysis incorrect?

Because when processing k=2, the code would process each character of S_2:

S_2 is "snuki" (length 5).

Traversing the trie:

m=1: 's' → node exists. min_val=4. cost= (5-1)+4=8.

m=2: 'sn' → node exists. min_val=3. cost=3+3=6.

m=3: 'snu' → node exists. min_val=2. cost=2+2=4.

m=4: 'snuk' → node exists. min_val=1. cost=1+1=2.

m=5: 'snuki' → node not in trie.

So the minimal cost is 2, which matches the sample answer.

Ah, so the initial approach is correct. The previous analysis was incorrect because I thought that j=1's prefix of m=4 is "snuke", but in reality, j=1's prefix of m=4 is "snuke"[:4] = "s n u k", which is "snuk". So the trie node for "snuk" exists, and the min_val is 1. So during processing k=2's m=4, the cost is 2.

Thus, the initial approach is correct.

The mistake in the previous analysis was a misunderstanding of the prefix of j=1's S_1.

So the initial approach is correct.

Now, the code needs to be implemented with this trie-based approach.

Now, implementing the trie in Python.

Each node is a dictionary of children and a min_val.

We can represent each node as a dictionary.

Initially, the root is a dictionary with 'children' as an empty dict and 'min_val' as infinity.

But in Python, using a class for nodes would be more efficient. However, for speed, perhaps using a dictionary of dictionaries.

But given the time constraints, perhaps using a class-based approach.

Alternatively, use a list of dictionaries.

But for the sake of code efficiency, let's use a class.

So:

class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.min_val = float('inf')

root = TrieNode()

Then, for inserting a prefix T of S_j:

current = root

for char in T:

    if char not in current.children:

        current.children[char] = TrieNode()

    current = current.children[char]

    current.min_val = min(current.min_val, len(S_j) - len(T))

Wait, no. Because T is the prefix of S_j of length m. So for each step in inserting T, the length of the prefix is m. So for example, if T is 's', m=1. Then, after inserting 's', the current node's min_val is min(inf, len(S_j) -1).

But in the code above, T is the entire prefix, and for each character in T, the code processes each character, and for each step, the current node's min_val is updated with len(S_j) - len(T). But len(T) is the length of the entire prefix, not the current step.

This is incorrect. Because for each step i (0-based) in T, the prefix length is i+1. So when inserting T, which is of length m, we need to process each character, and for each step, the prefix length is i+1. So for each step, the value is len(S_j) - (i+1).

So the code for inserting T should be:

current = root

for i in range(len(T)):

    char = T[i]

    if char not in current.children:

        current.children[char] = TrieNode()

    current = current.children[char]

    current.min_val = min(current.min_val, len(S_j) - (i+1))

Yes. This way, for each character in T, we process the prefix up to i+1, and update the min_val accordingly.

So the code for inserting all prefixes of S_j is:

for j in 1..N:

    s = S_j

    for m in 1..len(s):

        T = s[:m]

        current = root

        for char in T:

            if char not in current.children:

                current.children[char] = TrieNode()

            current = current.children[char]

            current.min_val = min(current.min_val, len(s) - (m if char == T[-1] else (i+1)))

Wait, no. Because for each m, T is s[:m]. So for each m, we need to process each character in T, and for each step i (0-based), the prefix length is i+1, and the value is len(s) - (i+1).

So for each m in 1..len(s):

    T = s[:m]

    current = root

    for i in range(m):

        char = T[i]

        if char not in current.children:

            current.children[char] = TrieNode()

        current = current.children[char]

        current.min_val = min(current.min_val, len(s) - (i+1))

This way, for each prefix of s (of length m), we process each character, and for each step i, update the node's min_val to be the minimum between its current value and len(s) - (i+1).

But this would require O(m^2) time for each string s of length m. Because for each m, we process m characters, and for each m, we do this. For example, for s of length L, the total steps are L*(L+1)/2, which is O(L^2). For sum L up to 2e5, this is O( (2e5)^2 ) steps, which is 4e10 and way too slow.

So this approach is not feasible.

Ah, this is a critical problem. The initial approach is correct, but the way of inserting all prefixes of S_j into the trie is O(L^2) per string, which is not feasible for large L.

So the initial approach is correct but not efficient enough.

This is a major issue. So we need to find a way to insert all prefixes of S_j into the trie in O(L) time per string.

How can we do this?

Instead of inserting each prefix separately, we can process the string S_j once, and for each character, build the trie nodes incrementally. For each character in S_j, we add it to the trie and update the min_val for the current node.

For example, for S_j = "abc":

Process 'a' → update node 'a' with len(S_j) -1 =3-1=2.

Process 'b' → update node 'ab' with len(S_j) -2=1.

Process 'c' → update node 'abc' with len(S_j) -3=0.

So for each character in S_j, we process it once, and for each step, we update the current node's min_val.

This way, inserting all prefixes of S_j into the trie takes O(L) time, where L is the length of S_j.

Yes! This is the key. Because when processing S_j's characters in order, for each character, we build the trie path incrementally. For each node in the path, we update the min_val to be the minimum between its current value and (len(S_j) - current depth).

So the code for inserting all prefixes of S_j is:

current = root

for i in range(len(S_j)):

    char = S_j[i]

    if char not in current.children:

        current.children[char] = TrieNode()

    current = current.children[char]

    current.min_val = min(current.min_val, len(S_j) - (i+1))

This way, for each character in S_j, we process it once, and for each node in the path (each prefix), we update the min_val. This takes O(L) time per string.

So for S_j of length L, inserting all prefixes into the trie takes O(L) time.

This is a crucial optimization.

So the code for inserting all prefixes of S_j is O(L), not O(L^2).

Thus, the initial approach is feasible.

Now, let's re-express the code.

For each k from 1 to N:

   1. Compute the answer for S_k:

      a. Initialize current_node to root.

      b. Initialize min_cost to len(S_k) (cost of deleting all).

      c. Traverse S_k's characters, keeping track of current_node and current m.

      d. For each character in S_k:

          i. If the character is not in current_node's children, break.

          ii. current_node = current_node's children[char]

          iii. m = current depth (i+1)

          iv. current_cost = (len(S_k) - m) + current_node.min_val

          v. if current_cost < min_cost, update min_cost.

      e. The answer for k is min(len(S_k), min_cost).

   2. Insert all prefixes of S_k into the trie:

      a. current_node = root

      b. for i in 0..len(S_k)-1:

          char = S_k[i]

          if char not in current_node's children:

              create new node.

          current_node = current_node's children[char]

          current_node.min_val = min(current_node.min_val, len(S_k) - (i+1))

So for each k, the answer is computed in O(L) time, and the insertion is O(L) time.

The total time for all k is O(sum L) = 2e5.

Thus, this approach is feasible.

Now, let's test this code for the sample input 1.

Sample Input 1:

3

snuke

snuki

snuuk

Processing k=1 (S_1 = "snuke"):

Answer computation:

current_node = root (min_val = inf).

Traverse S_1's characters:

char 's' → current_node has no children. So break. So min_cost remains len(S_1)=5.

Answer is 5.

Inserting S_1's prefixes:

current_node = root.

i=0: char 's' → create node. current_node is now 's' node. min_val = min(inf,5-1)=4.

i=1: char 'n' → create node. current_node is 'sn' node. min_val = min(inf,5-2)=3.

i=2: char 'u' → create node. min_val=5-3=2.

i=3: char 'k' → create node. min_val=5-4=1.

i=4: char 'e' → create node. min_val=5-5=0.

Processing k=2 (S_2 = "snuki"):

Answer computation:

current_node = root.

min_cost = 5 (len(S_2)).

Traverse S_2's characters:

char 's' → exists. current_node is 's' node. m=1. current_cost =5-1 +4=4+4=8. min_cost is 8.

char 'n' → exists. current_node is 'sn' node. m=2. current_cost=5-2+3=3+3=6. min_cost is 6.

char 'u' → exists. current_node is 'snu' node. m=3. current_cost=5-3+2=2+2=4. min_cost is4.

char 'k' → exists. current_node is 'snu
