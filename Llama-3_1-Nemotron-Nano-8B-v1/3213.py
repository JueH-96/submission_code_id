Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of subarrays where the maximum element appears at least k times. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, the problem says that for each subarray, the maximum element in it must appear at least k times. So, the maximum in the subarray is some value, and that value's count in the subarray is >=k. But how do I efficiently compute this for all possible subarrays?

Hmm. The brute force approach would be to check every possible subarray, find the maximum, count its occurrences, and check if it meets the condition. But with nums up to 1e5 elements, that's O(n^2) time, which is way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.

Let me think. The key is to find for each occurrence of the maximum element, how it contributes to valid subarrays. But since the maximum can vary depending on the subarray, this complicates things. For example, a subarray's maximum could be different from another's, so we can't just track a single maximum.

Wait, maybe we can process each element as a potential maximum and calculate the number of subarrays where it is the maximum and appears at least k times. Then sum all these contributions. But how to do that efficiently?

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a sliding window approach where we track the maximum in the window and its count. But maintaining the maximum in a sliding window is tricky. There's a way to do it with a deque for the maximum, but even then, combining that with counting the occurrences might be complex.

Another idea: For each element in the array, determine the regions where it is the maximum. Then, within those regions, count the number of subarrays where the element occurs at least k times. But how to find those regions?

This seems similar to the problem of finding the number of subarrays where a certain element is the maximum. For that, we can use a monotonic stack to find for each element the next greater element to the left and right. Then, the number of subarrays where this element is the maximum is (left_count + 1) * (right_count + 1). But how to integrate the count of the element in those subarrays?

Wait, but even if an element is the maximum in a subarray, we need to ensure that it appears at least k times in that subarray. So for each such subarray where the element is the maximum, we need to check if the count of that element in the subarray is >=k. But how to compute that efficiently.

Alternatively, for each element x, find all the positions where x occurs. Then, for each occurrence of x, determine the ranges where x is the maximum. Then, within those ranges, find the number of subarrays that include enough x's (at least k) and where x is the maximum.

But this seems complicated. Let's think of an example. Take the first example: [1,3,2,3,3], k=2. The maximum is 3. The positions of 3 are at indices 1,3,4. The subarrays where 3 is the maximum and appears at least twice are the ones listed. How can we model this?

For each occurrence of x (the maximum), perhaps we can find the left and right boundaries where x is the maximum. Then, within those boundaries, count the number of subarrays that include at least k x's. But how?

Alternatively, for each x, collect all the indices where x appears, and then for each window of k consecutive x's, calculate the number of subarrays that include this window and are contained within the maximum boundaries of x.

Wait, maybe this is the way. Let's think: for x to be the maximum in a subarray, the subarray must lie entirely within the interval where x is the maximum. So for each x, we can find all the intervals where x is the maximum. Then, within each such interval, we need to find the number of subarrays that contain at least k occurrences of x.

But how to find these intervals? The standard approach for finding the maximum in all subarrays uses a monotonic stack to find for each element the previous and next greater elements. For each element x at index i, the left boundary is the index of the last element greater than x (left_bound), and the right boundary is the index of the first element greater than or equal to x (right_bound). Then, the number of subarrays where x is the maximum is (i - left_bound) * (right_bound - i). But this gives the count of subarrays where x is the maximum. But we need to further filter those subarrays where x appears at least k times.

So, for each x, after finding all the intervals where x is the maximum, we can process each interval to count the number of subarrays in that interval that have at least k x's. Then sum all these counts across all x.

But how to compute the number of subarrays in a given interval [L, R] (the left and right boundaries) that contain at least k x's, where x is the maximum in those subarrays.

Wait, but the interval [L, R] is the range where x is the maximum. So any subarray within [L+1, R-1] (or whatever the exact boundaries are) that includes x's and has x as the maximum. So, the problem reduces to, for each x, in the interval where x is the maximum, count the number of subarrays that have at least k x's.

So, the steps could be:

1. For each element x in the array, find all the intervals where x is the maximum. For each such interval, collect the positions of x within that interval.

2. For each such interval, compute the number of subarrays within the interval that contain at least k x's, and where x is the maximum (which is already ensured by the interval).

But how to efficiently compute step 2?

Let's think of the positions of x in the interval. For example, in the first example, the interval for x=3 is from index 1 to 4 (since the next greater element is 5, which is beyond the array). The positions of x in this interval are 1,3,4.

We need to find all subarrays within [1,4] that include at least 2 of these positions, and the subarray's maximum is 3 (which is already the case here). So the problem reduces to, in the array [1,3,2,3,3], considering the interval [1,4], how many subarrays have at least 2 x's (3's) in them.

But how to compute that?

This is similar to the problem of counting the number of subarrays with at least k occurrences of a certain element. For a given array, how to compute the number of subarrays where the count of x is >=k.

But in this case, the array is the elements in the interval [L, R], and x is the element we are interested in. So, for each interval, we can collect the positions of x, and then compute the number of subarrays in the interval that include at least k of these positions.

But how to do that efficiently.

Let's think of the positions of x in the interval as a list. For example, in the first example, the positions are [1,3,4]. For k=2, we need to find all subarrays that include at least two of these positions.

The standard approach for this is to use a sliding window. For each window of k consecutive x's, find the leftmost and rightmost positions that can form a subarray containing these k x's, and then calculate the number of possible subarrays that include this window.

For example, for the positions [a0, a1, a2, ..., am], for each i from 0 to m -k +1, take the window from a_i to a_{i+k-1}. The number of subarrays that include this window is (a_i - prev_end +1) * (next_start - a_{i+k-1} +1). Here, prev_end is the position of the x before a_i (or -1 if none), and next_start is the position of the x after a_{i+k-1} (or n if none). Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, for each group of k x's, the left boundary is the previous x's position (or -1 if it's the first), and the right boundary is the next x's position (or n if it's the last). Then, the number of subarrays that include this group is (current_x_pos - left_x_pos) * (right_x_pos - current_x_pos + ...). Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, here's a method: For each window of k consecutive x's in the positions list, the leftmost start of the subarray is the position after the previous x (or start of the interval), and the rightmost end is the position before the next x (or end of the interval). Then, the number of possible subarrays that include this window is (left_available) * (right_available), where left_available is the number of possible choices for the left end (from previous_x_pos +1 to current_window_left_x_pos), and right_available is the number of possible choices for the right end (from current_window_right_x_pos to next_x_pos -1).

Wait, perhaps an example will help. Let's take the positions [1,3,4] in the first example. For k=2, the first window is positions 1 and 3. The previous x is none (since it's the first), so the left_available is 1 (from start of interval, which is 1, to 1). The next x after 3 is 4. So the right_available is 4 -3 =1 (from 3 to 4-1=3). So the number of subarrays for this window is 1 * (3 -3 +1) ? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, for the window [1,3], the left can start anywhere from the left boundary of the interval (which is 1) up to the first x in the window (1). The right can end anywhere from the last x in the window (3) up to the position before the next x (4-1=3). So the left has 1-1+1=1 options (only start at 1), and the right has 3-3+1=1 option (end at 3). So 1*1=1 subarray. But in the example, the subarrays that include 1 and 3 are [1,3,2,3], [1,3,2,3,3], etc. Wait, maybe this approach isn't capturing all possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that for a window of k x's (positions a_i, a_{i+1}, ..., a_{i+k-1}), the leftmost possible start of the subarray is the position after the previous x (prev) or the start of the interval. The rightmost possible end is the position before the next x (next) or the end of the interval. Then, the number of possible left choices is (a_i - prev) and the number of right choices is (next - a_{i+k-1} +1). Wait, maybe not. Let's see.

In the example, for the first window (positions 1 and 3), prev is -1 (since there's no x before 1), next is 4 (the next x after 3). So left choices are from 1 to 1 (since prev is -1, the start of the interval is 1). So left choices: 1 - (-1) = 2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the left can start anywhere from the left boundary of the interval (L) to a_i. The right can end anywhere from a_{i+k-1} to the right boundary of the interval (R). So the number of left options is (a_i - L +1), and the number of right options is (R - a_{i+k-1} +1). Then, the total for this window is left_options * right_options.

Wait, let's take the first example. The interval for x=3 is from L=1 to R=4 (since the next greater element is at 5, which is beyond the array). The positions of x in this interval are [1,3,4]. For k=2, the first window is positions 1 and 3. The left boundary is 1, the right boundary is 4. So left_options = 1 -1 +1 =1 (start can be 1). The right_options is 4 -3 +1 =2 (end can be 3 or 4). So 1*2=2 subarrays. But in the example, the subarrays [1,3,2,3] and [1,3,2,3,3] are part of this. But according to the example, there are 6 subarrays. Hmm, maybe this approach is missing something.

Wait, perhaps the window approach is not sufficient. Let's think again. For the positions [1,3,4], the possible windows of size 2 are [1,3] and [3,4]. For each window, calculate the number of subarrays that include all elements of the window.

For the first window [1,3], the left can start anywhere from 1 to 1 (since the previous x is none, so the left boundary is 1). The right can end anywhere from 3 to 4 (since the next x is 4). So the left options are 1 (start at 1), and the right options are 4-3+1=2 (end at 3 or 4). So 1*2=2 subarrays: [1..3] (indices 1-3) and [1..4] (indices 1-4). But in the example, the subarrays [1,3,2,3] (indices 1-3) and [1,3,2,3,3] (indices 1-4) are part of the answer. So that's 2 subarrays for this window.

For the second window [3,4], the left can start from 3 to 3 (since the previous x is 1, so the left boundary is 1+1=2. Wait, no. The left boundary for the interval is 1, but the previous x is 1. So the left can start from 1+1=2? Or is the left boundary the start of the interval (1) or the previous x's position (1) plus 1?

Hmm, perhaps the left boundary for the window is the position after the previous x. For example, in the first window, the previous x is none, so the left boundary is the start of the interval (1). For the second window [3,4], the previous x is 1. So the left boundary is 1+1=2. The next x is none (since 4 is the last element). So the right boundary is the end of the interval (4). So left options: 3-2+1=2 (start at 2 or 3). Right options: 4-4+1=1 (end at 4). So 2*1=2 subarrays. These would be [3..4] (indices 3-4) and [2..4] (indices 2-4). But in the example, the subarrays [3,2,3], [3,2,3,3], [2,3,3], [3,3] are part of the answer. Wait, but according to this calculation, the second window contributes 2 subarrays, but in the example, there are 4 subarrays that include the window [3,4]. So this approach is not capturing all possibilities.

Hmm, maybe the approach is incorrect. Let's think again. The problem is that the window of k x's can be part of a larger group. For example, in the positions [1,3,4], the window [3,4] is part of the group. But the subarrays that include this window can start before 3 and end after 4, as long as they are within the interval.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to consider that for a window of k x's (positions a_i, a_{i+1}, ..., a_{i+k-1}), the left can start anywhere from the position after the previous x (prev) to a_i. The right can end anywhere from a_{i+k-1} to the position before the next x (next). Then, the number of left options is (a_i - prev) and the number of right options is (next - a_{i+k-1} +1). Wait, but in the first example, for the window [1,3], prev is -1 (no previous x), next is 4 (the next x after 3). So left options: 1 - (-1) = 2 (start can be 0 or 1?), but the interval starts at 1. Hmm, maybe the prev is the position of the previous x, and the left can start from prev +1 to a_i. So for the first window, prev is -1, so left starts from 0 to 1. But the interval is from 1 to 4, so the left can't be less than 1. So perhaps the left starts from max(prev +1, L) to a_i. Similarly, the right ends from a_{i+k-1} to min(next -1, R). 

So for the first window [1,3], prev is -1, so left starts from max(-1+1, 1) =1. So left options: 1-1+1=1. Next x is 4, so right ends at min(4-1,4) =3. So right options: 3-3+1=1. So 1*1=1. But in the example, the subarrays [1,3,2,3] (indices 1-3) and [1,3,2,3,3] (indices 1-4) are part of the answer. Wait, but according to this, the right can end at 3. So the subarray [1-3] is included, but [1-4] is not. But in the example, [1-4] is a valid subarray. So this approach is missing that.

Ah, I see. The next x after 3 is 4. So the right can end at 4-1=3. But the interval's R is 4. So the right can end up to R. So perhaps the right is min(next, R+1) -1. Wait, maybe the next x is 4, which is part of the interval. So the right can end at 4. So the right options are 4-3+1=2. So the calculation would be 1*2=2. Which would include the subarrays [1-3] and [1-4]. That makes sense.

So the correct way is:

For a window of k x's (positions a_i, a_{i+1}, ..., a_{i+k-1}):

left_start can be from (prev_x_pos +1) to a_i. But prev_x_pos is the position of the x before a_i. If there is no previous x, then prev_x_pos is L-1 (where L is the start of the interval). Wait, no. The interval is [L, R], and the x's in this interval are the positions where x is the maximum. So the previous x in the entire array may not be in this interval. Hmm, this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the prev_x_pos is the position of the x in the positions list before a_i. For example, in the positions list [1,3,4], for the window [1,3], the previous x in the list is none, so prev_x_pos is -1. The next x in the list is 4. So the left_start can be from (prev_x_pos +1) to a_i. But since the interval is [1,4], the left_start can't be less than 1. So left_start ranges from max(prev_x_pos +1, L) to a_i. Similarly, the right_end can be from a_{i+k-1} to min(next_x_pos -1, R). But next_x_pos is the position of the x after a_{i+k-1} in the positions list. If there is no next x, then next_x_pos is R+1.

So for the first window [1,3], prev_x_pos is -1, next_x_pos is 4. L is 1, R is4. So left_start ranges from max(-1+1,1) =1 to 1. So left options: 1-1+1=1. Right_end ranges from 3 to min(4-1,4) =3. So right options: 3-3+1=1. So 1*1=1. But this is not correct, as the example includes [1-4] as a valid subarray.

Wait, this suggests that the approach is not working. What's wrong here?

Ah, perhaps the next_x_pos is the position of the next x in the entire array, not just the interval. But in the example, the next x after 3 is 4, which is in the interval. So the right_end can be up to 4. So the right_end should be min(next_x_pos, R+1) -1. Wait, maybe the next_x_pos is the position of the next x in the positions list. For the window [1,3], the next x in the positions list is 4. So the right_end can be up to 4-1=3. But the interval's R is 4, so the right_end can be up to 4. So perhaps the next_x_pos is the position of the next x in the positions list, and the right_end is min(next_x_pos, R+1) -1. So in this case, next_x_pos is 4, R is4. So min(4,4+1) is4. So right_end is 4-1=3. So the right options are 3-3+1=1. But the subarray [1-4] is valid. So this approach is not capturing that.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the problem is that the next x in the positions list is part of the interval. So the right_end can be up to R. So perhaps the next_x_pos is the position of the next x in the positions list. So for the window [1,3], the next x is 4. So the right_end can be up to 4-1=3. But the interval's R is4, so the right_end can be up to 4. So perhaps the right_end is min(next_x_pos, R+1) -1. So in this case, next_x_pos is4, R+1 is5. So min(4,5) is4. So right_end is4-1=3. So the right options are 3-3+1=1. But the subarray [1-4] is valid. So this approach is not capturing that.

Alternatively, perhaps the next_x_pos is the position of the next x in the positions list. So for the window [1,3], the next x is4. So the right_end can be up to 4-1=3. But the interval's R is4, so the right_end can be up to4. So perhaps the right_end is min(next_x_pos, R+1) -1. So in this case, next_x_pos is4, R+1 is5. So min(4,5) is4. So right_end is4-1=3. So the right options are 3-3+1=1. But the subarray [1-4] is valid. So this approach is not capturing that.

Wait, but the subarray [1-4] includes the x at position4. So the window [3,4] would be considered. Let's see. For the window [3,4], the prev_x_pos is1, next_x_pos is None (since it's the last in the list). So left_start is max(1+1, L) =2. So left options:3-2+1=2 (start at2 or3). Right_end is min(None, R+1) -1. Since next_x_pos is None, we treat it as R+1. So R is4, R+1 is5. So min(None,5) is5. So right_end is5-1=4. So right options:4-4+1=1. So 2*1=2. So the subarrays [2-4] and [3-4]. But in the example, the subarrays [3,2,3,3] (indices3-4) and [2,3,3] (indices2-4) are part of the answer. So this window contributes 2 subarrays. But according to the example, there are 4 subarrays that include the window [3,4]. So this approach is missing some.

Hmm, perhaps the approach is not correct. Let's think of another way. For each window of k x's, the number of subarrays that include this window and are within the interval [L, R] is (left_available) * (right_available), where left_available is the number of possible left endpoints (from the start of the window's left boundary to the first x in the window) and right_available is the number of possible right endpoints (from the last x in the window to the end of the window's right boundary).

Alternatively, for a window of k x's (positions a_0, a_1, ..., a_{k-1}), the left boundary is the position after the previous x (prev) or the start of the interval. The right boundary is the position before the next x (next) or the end of the interval. Then, the left_available is a_0 - prev, and the right_available is next - a_{k-1}. The number of subarrays is left_available * right_available.

Wait, let's try this. For the first example's window [1,3], prev is -1 (no previous x), next is4. So left_available is1 - (-1) =2. But the interval starts at1, so the left can't be less than1. So left_available is1- (-1) =2, but the actual left can be from0 to1. But the interval is from1 to4, so left can only be from1 to1. So this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the left_available is a_i - (prev_x_pos +1) +1. For example, prev_x_pos is the position of the x before a_i. So for the first window, prev_x_pos is -1. So left_available is1 - (-1 +1) +1 =1-0+1=2. But again, the interval starts at1, so the left can't be less than1. So this approach is not considering the interval boundaries.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let's think of the problem as follows: for each x, find all the intervals where x is the maximum, and then for each such interval, compute the number of subarrays within that interval that have at least k occurrences of x.

To compute the number of subarrays with at least k occurrences of x in a given interval, we can use the sliding window technique. For example, for the interval [L, R], and the positions of x in this interval are sorted as pos[0], pos[1], ..., pos[m-1]. Then, for each i from 0 to m -k, we can find the earliest j such that pos[j] - pos[i] >=k-1 (since the window is of size k). Then, the number of subarrays that include this window can be calculated based on the left and right boundaries.

Alternatively, for each window of k consecutive x's in the interval, the left can start anywhere from the position after the previous x (or the start of the interval) to the first x in the window. The right can end anywhere from the last x in the window to the position before the next x (or the end of the interval). The number of such subarrays is (left_available) * (right_available), where left_available is (pos[i] - left_bound +1), and right_available is (right_bound - pos[i +k-1] +1).

Let's try this with the first example. The interval is [1,4], positions of x are [1,3,4]. For k=2, the windows are [1,3] and [3,4].

For window [1,3]:

left_bound is the position after the previous x. Since there is no previous x, left_bound is L (1). So left_available is 1 -1 +1 =1.

right_bound is the position before the next x. The next x is4. So right_bound is4-1=3. So right_available is3 -3 +1=1. So 1*1=1.

For window [3,4]:

left_bound is the position after the previous x (1) → 1+1=2. So left_available is3-2 +1=2.

right_bound is the position after the next x (none, so R=4). So right_available is4 -4 +1=1. So 2*1=2.

Total for this interval is1+2=3. But the example's answer is6. So this approach is not working.

Wait, but the example's answer is6. So where is the mistake?

In the example, the valid subarrays are:

[1,3,2,3], [1,3,2,3,3], [3,2,3], [3,2,3,3], [2,3,3], [3,3].

These are 6 subarrays. But according to the current approach, the sum is1+2=3. So this approach is missing 3 subarrays.

Hmm. So perhaps the approach is not considering overlapping windows or something else.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the window approach counts the subarrays that include exactly k x's, but the problem requires at least k x's. So for example, a subarray with 3 x's would be counted in multiple windows. But the current approach counts each window once, leading to overcounting.

Ah, right! Because a subarray with m >=k x's will be counted in (m -k +1) different windows. So the current approach would count each such subarray multiple times, leading to an overcount.

So this approach is incorrect. We need a way to count each valid subarray exactly once.

So the sliding window approach for at least k occurrences is different. For example, the standard approach for counting the number of subarrays with at least k occurrences of x is to compute the total number of subarrays minus the number of subarrays with less than k occurrences. But how to compute that.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to use a sliding window to find the number of subarrays with at least k occurrences. Let's think:

For a given array, the number of subarrays with at least k occurrences of x can be found by sliding a window and keeping track of the count. But this is O(n) time. But in our case, the array is the interval [L, R], and x is the maximum. So for each interval, we can process the elements in the interval and count the number of subarrays with at least k x's. But for large intervals (up to 1e5 elements), this would be O(n) per interval, leading to O(n^2) time in the worst case.

But given that the constraints are up to 1e5 elements, this is not feasible.

So we need a more efficient way.

Alternative idea: For each x, find all the intervals where x is the maximum. For each such interval, collect the positions of x in the interval. Then, for each such interval, compute the number of subarrays in the interval that have at least k x's. Sum all these numbers.

The key is to compute the number of subarrays with at least k x's in O(m) time, where m is the number of x's in the interval.

The standard approach for this is to use a sliding window. Let's see:

Initialize left=0, count=0, result=0.

For each right in 0 to m-1:

   if pos[right] is in the interval, increment count.

   while count >=k:

       result += (n - right) 

       count -= (pos[left] is in the interval)

       left +=1

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the standard approach for counting the number of subarrays with at least k occurrences of x is to compute the total number of subarrays (n*(n+1)/2) minus the number of subarrays with less than k occurrences. But how to compute the latter.

Alternatively, the sliding window approach for at least k:

We can use a sliding window to find the number of subarrays where the count of x is >=k. For each right, find the smallest left such that the window [left, right] has at least k x's. Then, the number of valid subarrays ending at right is (right - left +1). But this is for contiguous subarrays. Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the standard approach for counting the number of subarrays with sum at least k is to use a sliding window. But for this problem, it's the same as counting the number of subarrays where the count of x is >=k.

So here's the approach:

Initialize left=0, count=0, result=0.

For each right in 0 to m-1:

   if pos[right] is in the interval, increment count.

   while count >=k:

       result += (m - right) 

       count -= (pos[left] is in the interval)

       left +=1

Wait, no. Let's think again. For each right, we want to find the earliest left such that the window [left, right] has at least k x's. Then, the number of valid subarrays ending at right is (right - left +1). But this is for the case where the x's are in a list. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think of the positions of x in the interval as a list. For example, the list is [1,3,4]. For k=2, the valid subarrays are those that include at least two x's.

The sliding window approach would track the left and right pointers in the list of x's. For each i, find the earliest j such that j >=i and the window from j to i has at least k x's. Then, the number of subarrays is (pos[i] - pos[j] +1) * (pos[j+k-1] - pos[j] +1). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, for the list of x's positions in the interval, the number of subarrays with at least k x's can be computed as follows:

For each window of k x's (positions a_0, a_1, ..., a_{k-1}), the number of subarrays that include this window is (a_0 - L +1) * (R - a_{k-1} +1). Then, sum this for all possible windows. But this would count overlapping windows multiple times. For example, a subarray with 3 x's would be counted in two windows (the first two and the last two). So this approach overcounts.

So this is not the correct way.

Hmm. This is getting really tricky. Let's think of the example again. For the interval [1,4], x's positions are [1,3,4]. k=2.

The valid subarrays are:

[1,3,2,3] → includes x's at 1 and3.

[1,3,2,3,3] → x's at1,3,4.

[3,2,3] → x's at3 and4.

[3,2,3,3] → x's at3 and4.

[2,3,3] → x's at3 and4.

[3,3] → x's at3 and4.

So total 6.

Now, how to model this.

Each of these subarrays must include at least two x's. Let's see:

The first subarray starts at1 and ends at3. The x's are at1 and3.

The second starts at1 and ends at4. x's are1,3,4.

The third starts at3 and ends at4. x's are3,4.

The fourth starts at3 and ends at4. x's are3,4.

The fifth starts at2 and ends at4. x's are3,4.

The sixth starts at3 and ends at4. x's are3,4.

So for the window [1,3], the subarrays that include this window are those that start <=1 and end >=3. So the start can be1, and the end can be3 or4. So 1*2=2 subarrays.

For the window [3,4], the subarrays that include this window are those that start <=3 and end >=4. The start can be1,2,3. The end can be4. So 3*1=3 subarrays. But wait, the start can be from1 to3. So 3 options. So 3*1=3. But in the example, the subarrays [3,2,3], [3,2,3,3], [2,3,3], [3,3] are part of the answer. Wait, but according to this, the window [3,4] contributes 3 subarrays. But in the example, there are 4 subarrays that include this window. So this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider that for each window of k x's, the number of subarrays that include this window is (left_available) * (right_available), where left_available is the number of possible left endpoints (from the start of the window's left boundary to the first x in the window) and right_available is the number of possible right endpoints (from the last x in the window to the end of the window's right boundary).

But in the example, for the window [3,4], the left_available is3-2+1=2 (start can be2 or3), and right_available is4-4+1=1. So 2*1=2. But the example has 4 subarrays that include this window. So this approach is missing something.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I need to find a different approach.

Alternative approach: For each x, find all the intervals where x is the maximum. For each such interval, compute the number of subarrays in that interval that have at least k x's. Sum all these.

To compute the number of subarrays with at least k x's in a given interval, we can use the following method:

Let the positions of x in the interval be pos[0], pos[1], ..., pos[m-1]. We need to find the number of subarrays [i,j] in the interval such that the number of x's in [i,j] is >=k.

This is equivalent to the number of pairs (i,j) where i <= j, and the count of x's in [i,j] >=k.

The standard way to compute this is to use a sliding window. For each right, find the smallest left such that the window [left, right] has at least k x's. Then, the number of valid subarrays ending at right is (right - left +1). But this is for the entire array. However, in our case, the array is the interval [L, R], and x's positions are pos[0..m-1].

Wait, but the interval is [L, R], and the x's are at pos[0], pos[1], ..., pos[m-1]. So the positions are sorted in increasing order.

So for each window of k x's (pos[i], pos[i+1], ..., pos[i+k-1]), the number of subarrays that include this window is (pos[i] - L +1) * (R - pos[i+k-1] +1). But this counts all subarrays that start anywhere from L to pos[i], and end anywhere from pos[i+k-1] to R. But this includes subarrays that have more than k x's. For example, a subarray that includes pos[i], pos[i+1], pos[i+2] would be counted in both i and i+1.

So this approach overcounts. So this is not the way.

Alternative idea: For each x, the number of subarrays where x is the maximum and appears at least k times is equal to the sum over all possible windows of k x's in the interval, of the number of subarrays that include this window and are contained within the interval.

But this will count each valid subarray exactly once. For example, a subarray with m >=k x's will be counted in (m -k +1) different windows. So the total count is the sum for each window of the number of subarrays that include it. But this will overcount.

So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me think of the problem differently. The maximum element in the subarray must appear at least k times. So for a subarray to be valid, the maximum element in it must be some x, and x must appear at least k times in the subarray.

So the total number of valid subarrays is the sum over all x of the number of subarrays where x is the maximum and appears at least k times.

So the problem reduces to, for each x, compute the number of subarrays where x is the maximum and appears at least k times. Sum all these.

So the key is to compute for each x, the number of subarrays where x is the maximum and appears at least k times.

To compute this, we can use the standard approach for finding the number of subarrays where x is the maximum, and then subtract those subarrays where x appears less than k times.

But how?

The standard approach for finding the number of subarrays where x is the maximum is to use a monotonic stack to find for each x the previous and next greater elements. Then, for each x at position i, the number of subarrays where x is the maximum is (i - left) * (right - i), where left is the index of the previous greater element, and right is the index of the next greater or equal element.

But this gives the total number of subarrays where x is the maximum. We need to subtract the number of subarrays where x is the maximum but appears less than k times.

So for each x, the contribution is (number of subarrays where x is the maximum) minus (number of subarrays where x is the maximum and appears less than k times).

But how to compute the latter.

Alternatively, for each x, compute the number of subarrays where x is the maximum and appears at least k times. This can be done by finding the intervals where x is the maximum, and then within each interval, compute the number of subarrays that have at least k x's.

So the problem now is, for each interval [L, R] where x is the maximum, compute the number of subarrays within [L, R] that have at least k x's.

This is the same as the problem we were trying to solve earlier.

So the crux of the problem is to compute, for a given interval [L, R], the number of subarrays within [L, R] that have at least k occurrences of x.

But how to do this efficiently.

Let's think of the positions of x in [L, R] as pos[0], pos[1], ..., pos[m-1]. We need to find the number of pairs (i,j) such that i <= j, and the number of x's in [i,j] is >=k.

This is equivalent to the number of subarrays that include at least k x's.

The standard approach for this is to use a sliding window. Let's see:

Initialize left=0, count=0, result=0.

For each right in 0 to m-1:

   if pos[right] is in the interval, increment count.

   while count >=k:

       result += (m - right) 

       count -= (pos[left] is in the interval)

       left +=1

Wait, no. Let's think again. The standard approach for counting the number of subarrays with at least k occurrences of x is to compute the total number of subarrays minus the number of subarrays with less than k occurrences.

The total number of subarrays in the interval is (R-L+1) * (R-L+2)/2. But this is not helpful.

Alternatively, the sliding window approach for at least k:

We can use a sliding window to find the number of subarrays with at least k x's. For each right, find the smallest left such that the window [left, right] has at least k x's. Then, the number of valid subarrays ending at right is (right - left +1). But this is for the entire array. However, in our case, the array is the interval [L, R], and the x's are at pos[0..m-1].

Wait, but the positions are sorted. So for the interval [L, R], the x's are at pos[0], pos[1], ..., pos[m-1]. So the positions are in increasing order.

So for each i in 0 to m-1, the earliest j such that j >=i and the window [pos[i], pos[j]] has at least k x's. Then, the number of subarrays that include this window is (pos[i] - L +1) * (R - pos[j] +1). But this is not correct.

Alternatively, for each window of k x's (pos[i], pos[i+1], ..., pos[i+k-1]), the number of subarrays that include this window is (pos[i] - L +1) * (R - pos[i+k-1] +1). Summing this for all i from 0 to m-k gives the total number of subarrays with at least k x's. But this overcounts.

For example, in the first example, the window [1,3] contributes (1-1+1) * (4-3+1) =1*2=2. The window [3,4] contributes (3-1+1) * (4-4+1) =3*1=3. Sum is5. But the example's answer is6. So this approach is missing one.

Hmm. So this approach is not correct.

Another idea: For each x, the number of subarrays where x is the maximum and appears at least k times is equal to the sum over all possible windows of k x's in the interval, of the number of subarrays that include this window and are contained within the interval.

But this will count each valid subarray exactly once. For example, a subarray with m >=k x's will be counted in (m -k +1) different windows. So the total count is the sum for each window of the number of subarrays that include it. But this overcounts.

So this approach is not correct.

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Alternative approach inspired by the example:

In the first example, the valid subarrays are those that include at least two 3's and have 3 as the maximum. The maximum is 3 in all these subarrays.

The positions of 3 are at 1,3,4. The intervals where 3 is the maximum are from 1 to4.

So the problem reduces to, within the interval [1,4], count the number of subarrays that have at least two 3's.

The answer is6.

So how to compute this.

The positions of 3 in the interval are [1,3,4]. The number of subarrays with at least two 3's can be computed as follows:

For each possible window of two 3's:

- [1,3]: the subarrays that include this window are those that start <=1 and end >=3. The start can be1, and the end can be3 or4. So 1*2=2.

- [3,4]: the subarrays that include this window are those that start <=3 and end >=4. The start can be1,2,3. The end can be4. So 3*1=3.

Total 2+3=5. But the example's answer is6. So this approach is missing one.

Ah, but there's another subarray [1,3,2,3,3] which includes three 3's. This subarray is counted in the window [1,3] and [3,4]. So this approach counts it twice. But the correct answer counts it once. So the approach overcounts.

So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. So the problem is that a subarray with m >=k x's is counted in (m -k +1) windows. So the sum of the contributions from each window is equal to the total number of valid subarrays plus (m -k) times the number of valid subarrays. So this approach is not correct.

So I need a way to count each valid subarray exactly once.

Alternative idea: For each valid subarray, find the leftmost and rightmost x's in the subarray. Then, the subarray is counted in the window that starts with the leftmost x and ends with the rightmost x. But this is not clear.

Alternatively, for a subarray with m >=k x's, the earliest window of k x's that it contains is the first k x's. So each subarray is counted exactly once in the earliest window of k x's that it contains. So the approach would be to find for each subarray the earliest window of k x's that it contains, and count it there. But how to compute this.

This seems complicated.

Another idea: The number of subarrays with at least k x's is equal to the sum for each i from 0 to m-1 of the number of j >=i such that j -i +1 >=k. But this is not correct.

Alternatively, the number of subarrays with at least k x's is the sum for each i from 0 to m-k of (m -i) choose 2. No, that's not right.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me think of the problem in terms of the positions of x in the interval. For example, in the first example, the positions are [1,3,4]. The valid subarrays are those that include at least two of these positions. The total number of such subarrays is the number of pairs (i,j) where i <=j and the number of x's in [i,j] >=2.

But how to compute this.

The total number of subarrays in the interval is (4-1+1) * (4-1+2)/2 =4*5/2=10. The number of subarrays with less than 2 x's is 10-6=4. So the answer is10-4=6.

But how to compute the number of subarrays with less than k x's.

The number of subarrays with less than k x's can be computed using a sliding window approach. For example, for k=2, we can find all subarrays with 0 or 1 x's.

But how.

The standard approach for this is to use a sliding window to find the number of subarrays with at most (k-1) x's. Then subtract this from the total number of subarrays.

So for the interval [L, R], the total number of subarrays is (R-L+1) * (R-L+2)/2. The number of subarrays with at most (k-1) x's is computed using a sliding window. Then, the answer is total - sliding_window_result.

But how to compute the sliding_window_result.

The sliding window approach for at most (k-1) x's:

Initialize left=0, count=0, result=0.

For each right in 0 to m-1:

   if pos[right] is in the interval, increment count.

   while count > (k-1):

       count -= (pos[left] is in the interval)

       left +=1

   result += (right - left +1)

So for each right, the number of valid subarrays ending at right is (right - left +1). Summing these gives the total number of subarrays with at most (k-1) x's.

Then, the answer for the interval is total_subarrays - sliding_window_result.

Let's test this with the first example.

Interval [1,4], positions [1,3,4]. k=2.

Total subarrays: (4-1+1) * (4-1+2)/2 =4*5/2=10.

Sliding window for at most 1 x's:

left=0, count=0, result=0.

right=0 (pos=1):

count becomes1. count <=1. result +=0-0+1=1.

right=1 (pos=3):

count becomes2. Now count>1. So enter while loop:

count -=1 (pos[0] is in interval). count=1. left=1.

result +=1-1+1=1. total result=2.

right=2 (pos=4):

count becomes2. enter while loop:

count -= pos[1] (3 is in interval). count=1. left=2.

result +=2-2+1=1. total result=3.

So sliding_window_result=3.

Total answer for interval is10-3=7. But the example's answer is6. So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. What's wrong here.

Wait, the interval is [1,4], which has 4 elements. The positions of x are 1,3,4. So the subarrays with at most 1 x are:

[1], [3], [4], [2], [2,3], [2,4], [3,4], [1,2], [1,3], [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4], [1,3,4], [2,3,4], [1,2,4], etc. Wait, no. The interval is [1,4], which includes elements 1,3,2,3. So the subarrays are:

Indices 1-1: [1] → 1 x.

1-2: [1,3] → 2 x's.

1-3: [1,3,2] →1 x.

1-4: [1,3,2,3] →2 x's.

2-2: [3] →1 x.

2-3: [3,2] →0 x's.

2-4: [3,2,3] →2 x's.

3-3: [2] →0 x's.

3-4: [2,3] →1 x.

4-4: [3] →1 x.

So the subarrays with at most 1 x are:

[1], [1,3,2], [3], [3,2], [2], [2,3], [3], [4], [3,2,3], [2,3], [3].

Wait, this is getting messy. But according to the sliding window approach, the result is3. But the actual number of subarrays with at most 1 x is 7. So 10-7=3, but the example's answer is6. So this approach is not working.

Hmm. So the sliding window approach is not correctly counting the number of subarrays with at most (k-1) x's.

What's wrong with the sliding window approach?

The sliding window approach is applied to the list of x's positions. For the example, the positions are [1,3,4]. The code is:

left=0, count=0, result=0.

For right=0 (pos=1):

count=1. count <=1. result +=0-0+1=1.

For right=1 (pos=3):

count=2. enter loop: count becomes1, left=1. result +=1-1+1=1. total 2.

For right=2 (pos=4):

count=2. enter loop: count becomes1, left=2. result +=2-2+1=1. total 3.

So the result is3. But the actual number of subarrays with at most 1 x is7. So the approach is not correct.

Ah, I see. The sliding window approach is counting the number of subarrays of x's positions, not the actual subarrays in the interval. So this approach is incorrect.

So the problem is that the sliding window is applied to the list of x's positions, but the actual subarrays are in the interval [L, R], and the x's are not necessarily consecutive.

So this approach is not applicable.

Hmm. This is really challenging.

Alternative idea: For each x, find all the intervals where x is the maximum. For each such interval, compute the number of subarrays in the interval that have at least k x's. To compute this, we can use a sliding window approach on the interval itself, not just the x's positions.

But for large intervals (up to 1e5 elements), this would be O(n) per interval, leading to O(n^2) time in the worst case. Which is not feasible.

So this approach is not efficient enough.

Hmm. So what's the alternative?

Perhaps we can pre-process the array to find for each x, the intervals where x is the maximum, and then for each such interval, compute the number of subarrays with at least k x's using a sliding window approach. But this would be O(n) per interval, which is not feasible for large n.

But maybe the number of intervals is manageable. For example, each element can be part of at most O(1) intervals. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of intervals where x is the maximum is O(n) in total. For example, each element can be the maximum in O(1) intervals. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the number of intervals is O(n) in total. For example, each element can be the maximum in a single interval. Because the intervals are determined by the previous and next greater elements. So for each element, there is exactly one interval where it is the maximum. So the total number of intervals is O(n).

If that's the case, then processing each interval with O(m) time (where m is the length of the interval) would be O(n) time in total.

But how to compute the number of subarrays with at least k x's in an interval of length m in O(m) time.

Yes, using the sliding window approach on the interval.

So the steps would be:

1. For each element x in the array, find the interval [L, R] where x is the maximum. This can be done using a monotonic stack to find for each x the previous and next greater elements.

2. For each such interval, collect the positions of x in the interval.

3. For each interval, compute the number of subarrays in [L, R] that have at least k x's. This can be done using a sliding window approach on the interval.

4. Sum all these counts.

The key is to implement steps 1 and 3 efficiently.

Let's start with step 1: finding the intervals where x is the maximum.

This can be done using a monotonic stack. For each element, find the previous greater element (PGE) and the next greater or equal element (NGE). The interval for x is [PGE+1, NGE-1]. For example, if x is at index i, PGE is the index of the last element greater than x to the left, and NGE is the index of the first element greater than or equal to x to the right. Then, the interval where x is the maximum is [PGE+1, NGE-1].

Once we have the interval [L, R], we can collect all the positions of x in this interval. These are the indices in the original array where x is present and lies within [L, R].

But how to collect these positions efficiently.

We can pre-process the array to store for each x, a list of its indices. Then, for each interval [L, R], we can binary search in x's list to find the indices that are within [L, R].

For example, for x=3 in the first example, the list of indices is [1,3,4]. The interval is [1,4]. So all indices are included.

Once we have the list of x's positions in the interval, we can proceed to compute the number of subarrays with at least k x's.

For step 3: compute the number of subarrays in [L, R] with at least k x's.

This can be done using a sliding window approach on the interval [L, R]. We can iterate through each element in the interval, keeping track of the count of x's. For each right, we find the smallest left such that the window [left, right] has at least k x's. The number of valid subarrays ending at right is (right - left +1). Summing these gives the total.

But this is O(R-L+1) time per interval. Since the total number of intervals is O(n), and the sum of (R-L+1) over all intervals is O(n), this would be O(n) time in total.

So the overall time complexity is O(n) for the monotonic stack step, O(n) for the sliding window steps, leading to O(n) time.

This seems feasible.

So the plan is:

Implement the following steps:

1. Preprocess the array to find for each element x, the previous greater element (PGE) and next greater or equal element (NGE). This can be done using a monotonic stack.

2. For each element x at index i, compute the interval [L, R] where x is the maximum. L = PGE[i] +1, R = NGE[i] -1.

3. For each x, collect all the indices where x appears in the array. This can be stored in a dictionary.

4. For each interval [L, R], find the list of x's indices in this interval by binary searching in x's list.

5. For each such list, compute the number of subarrays in [L, R] that have at least k x's using a sliding window approach.

6. Sum all these counts.

Now, let's think about the implementation.

First, implementing the monotonic stack to find PGE and NGE.

For PGE:

We can use a stack that stores indices in decreasing order of their values. For each element i, we pop elements from the stack while the top element is <= nums[i]. The PGE[i] is the top element of the stack after popping. If the stack is empty, PGE[i] is -1.

For NGE:

Similarly, we iterate from the end of the array. For each element i, we pop elements from the stack while the top element is < nums[i]. The NGE[i] is the top element of the stack after popping. If the stack is empty, NGE[i] is n.

Wait, but for NGE, we need to find the next element that is greater than or equal to nums[i]. So the condition is while stack is not empty and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[i], pop. Then, NGE[i] is stack[-1] if stack is not empty, else n.

Once we have PGE and NGE arrays, for each index i, the interval where nums[i] is the maximum is [PGE[i]+1, NGE[i]-1].

Next, for each x, collect the list of indices where x appears. We can do this by iterating through the array and appending each index to a dictionary.

Then, for each interval [L, R], and for the x at nums[i], we need to find the indices in x's list that are within [L, R]. This can be done using binary search.

For example, for x's list sorted in increasing order, find the first index >= L and <= R.

Once we have the list of positions in the interval, we can proceed to compute the number of subarrays with at least k x's.

To compute this, we can use a sliding window approach on the interval [L, R]. We need to count the number of subarrays [a, b] where a <= b, and the number of x's in [a, b] is >=k.

The sliding window approach for this is:

Initialize left=0, count=0, result=0.

For each right in 0 to m-1 (where m is the number of x's in the interval):

   if pos[right] is in the interval, increment count.

   while count >=k:

       result += (m - right) 

       count -= (pos[left] is in the interval)

       left +=1

Wait, no. The standard sliding window approach for counting the number of subarrays with at least k occurrences is to find for each right the earliest left such that the window [left, right] has at least k x's. Then, the number of valid subarrays ending at right is (right - left +1). But this is for the entire array. However, in our case, the array is the interval [L, R], and the x's are at pos[0..m-1].

But the positions are sorted, so we can process them in order.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to process the positions of x in the interval in sorted order. For each position in the interval, we can track the count of x's in the current window.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the sliding window approach for the interval [L, R] can be done as follows:

Initialize left=0, count=0, result=0.

For each right in L to R:

   if nums[right] == x, increment count.

   while count >=k:

       result += (R - right +1)

       count -= (nums[left] == x)

       left +=1

But this is O(R-L+1) time per interval, which is acceptable.

But this approach is not correct. For example, in the first example, the interval is [1,4], x=3. The positions are 1,3,4.

The code would process each element in the interval:

Indices 1,2,3,4 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Need to clarify.)

Wait, the array is 0-based or 1-based? The problem statement says nums is an array of integers. In Python, it's 0-based.

So in the first example, nums = [1,3,2,3,3]. The interval for x=3 at index 1 is [PGE[1]+1, NGE[1]-1]. PGE[1] is the previous greater element. Let's compute PGE and NGE.

For PGE:

Processing from left to right.

i=0: stack is empty. PGE[0] = -1. stack becomes [0].

i=1: nums[1] =3. stack has 0 (nums[0]=1). 1 <=3, so pop. stack is empty. PGE[1] =-1. stack appends 1.

i=2: nums[2]=2. stack has 1 (3). 3>2. So PGE[2] =1. stack remains [1].

i=3: nums[3]=3. stack has 1 (3). 3 <=3 → pop. stack is empty. PGE[3] =-1. stack appends 3.

i=4: nums[4]=3. stack has 3 (3). 3 <=3 → pop. stack is empty. PGE[4] =-1. stack appends4.

For NGE:

Processing from right to left.

i=4: stack is empty. NGE[4] =5. stack appends4.

i=3: nums[3]=3. stack has4 (3). 3 <3 → no. So NGE[3] =4. stack remains [4].

i=2: nums[2]=2. stack has4 (3). 3>2 → NGE[2] =4. stack remains [4].

i=1: nums[1]=3. stack has4 (3). 3 >=3 → NGE[1] =4. stack remains [4].

i=0: nums[0]=1. stack has4 (3). 3>1 → NGE[0] =1. stack remains [4].

So for i=1 (nums[1]=3), PGE[i] =-1, NGE[i] =4. So the interval is [0,3] (since PGE[i]+1=0, NGE[i]-1=3).

So the interval is from 0 to3 (indices 0,1,2,3). The elements are [1,3,2,3].

The x's positions in this interval are 1 and3.

So the code would process the interval [0,3], x=3.

The code would iterate from 0 to3:

left=0, count=0, result=0.

right=0: nums[0] is1. count remains0. no change.

right=1: nums[1] is3. count=1. count <2. no change.

right=2: nums[2] is2. count remains1. no change.

right=3: nums[3] is3. count=2. now count >=2.

result += (3-3+1) =1. count becomes1. left=1.

So result is1.

But the valid subarrays in this interval are [1,3,2,3], [3,2,3], [3,2,3,3] (wait, but the interval is up to3). So the valid subarrays are [1,3,2,3], [3,2,3]. So the code returns1, but the correct count is2.

So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. So the sliding window approach on the interval is not working.

What's wrong here?

The code is processing the entire interval [L, R], but the x's are at positions 1 and3. The code counts the number of subarrays with at least 2 x's. But in the interval [0,3], the x's are at1 and3. The valid subarrays are:

[0,1,2,3] → x's at1 and3.

[1,2,3] → x's at1 and3.

[3,3] → x's at3.

Wait, no. The subarrays must have at least 2 x's. So the valid subarrays are:

[0,1,2,3] → x's at1 and3.

[1,2,3] → x's at1 and3.

[1,3] → x's at1 and3.

[0,1,3] → x's at1 and3.

[0,3] → x's at1 and3.

[1,3,3] → but the interval is up to3. So the subarrays are:

[0,1,2,3] → x's at1,3.

[0,1,3] → x's at1,3.

[0,3] → x's at1,3.

[1,2,3] → x's at1,3.

[1,3] → x's at1,3.

[3,3] → x's at3.

So the valid subarrays are those with at least two x's. So the valid ones are the first five. But according to the code, the result is1. So the code is not working.

So the sliding window approach on the interval is not correct.

Hmm. So what's the problem?

The code is counting the number of subarrays where the count of x's is >=k. But in the interval [0,3], the x's are at1 and3. The code's sliding window approach is:

For each right in 0 to3:

   if nums[right] is x, increment count.

   while count >=k:

       result += (3 - right +1)

       count -= (nums[left] ==x)

       left +=1

So let's step through this:

left=0, count=0, result=0.

right=0: nums[0] is1. count=0. no change.

right=1: nums[1] is3. count=1. count <2. no change.

right=2: nums[2] is2. count=1. no change.

right=3: nums[3] is3. count=2. enter loop.

result += (3-3+1) =1. count becomes1. left=1.

So result is1.

But the valid subarrays are:

[0,1,2,3] → count=2.

[0,1,3] → count=2.

[0,3] → count=2.

[1,2,3] → count=2.

[1,3] → count=2.

So 5 subarrays. But the code returns1.

So the code is not working.

The problem is that the code is adding (3 - right +1) when count >=k. But this is not correct. For example, when right=3, the code adds 1, which is the number of subarrays ending at3 with count >=2. But in reality, there are multiple subarrays ending at3 with count >=2.

So the code is not correctly counting the number of valid subarrays.

The correct approach for the sliding window is to find, for each right, the earliest left such that the window [left, right] has at least k x's. Then, the number of valid subarrays ending at right is (right - left +1). Summing these gives the total.

But in the example, when right=3, the earliest left is0. So the number of valid subarrays ending at3 is3-0+1=4. But the code is adding1.

So the code is not correctly implementing the sliding window approach.

Ah, I see. The code is adding (3 - right +1) when count >=k, but this is not the correct way. The correct way is to add (right - left +1) for each right where count >=k.

So the code should be:

Initialize left=0, count=0, result=0.

For each right in L to R:

   if nums[right] ==x:

       count +=1

   while count >=k:

       result += (right - left +1)

       count -= (nums[left] ==x)

       left +=1

So for the example:

right=0: count=0.

right=1: count=1.

right=2: count=1.

right=3: count=2.

enter loop:

result +=3-0+1=4. count becomes1. left=1.

So result is4.

But the valid subarrays ending at3 are:

[0,1,2,3], [0,1,3], [0,3], [1,2,3], [1,3]. So 5 subarrays. But the code adds4.

Hmm. So this approach is also not correct.

Wait, what's the correct number of valid subarrays ending at3?

The valid subarrays are those that include at least two x's. The x's are at1 and3.

So the subarrays ending at3 are:

[0,1,2,3] → x's at1 and3.

[0,1,3] → x's at1 and3.

[0,3] → x's at1 and3.

[1,2,3] → x's at1 and3.

[1,3] → x's at1 and3.

[3,3] → x's at3.

So 5 subarrays ending at3 with at least two x's. But according to the code, it's adding4.

So the code is not correct.

Hmm. So what's wrong with the code.

The code is adding (right - left +1) when count >=k. But in this case, when right=3, left=0. So (3-0+1)=4. But there are5 valid subarrays.

So the code is missing one.

Ah, because when count >=k, the code adds (right - left +1) and then moves left forward. But in this case, after adding4, left becomes1, and count becomes1. So the code is adding the number of subarrays from left=0 to right=3, which is4 subarrays. But there are5 valid subarrays.

So the code is not correct.

Hmm. So the sliding window approach is not working.

This suggests that the sliding window approach is not the correct way to count the number of subarrays with at least k x's.

So what's the correct way?

The correct way is to use a sliding window to find the number of subarrays with at least k x's. For each right, find the smallest left such that the window [left, right] has at least k x's. Then, the number of valid subarrays ending at right is (right - left +1). Summing these gives the total.

But in the example, when right=3, the smallest left is0. So (3-0+1)=4. But there are5 valid subarrays. So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. So what's the correct way to count the number of subarrays with at least k x's.

Let me think of the example again. The x's are at positions1 and3. The valid subarrays ending at3 are:

[0,1,2,3], [0,1,3], [0,3], [1,2,3], [1,3], [3,3].
