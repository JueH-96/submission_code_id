Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about generating the powerful array for each integer, then building a big_nums array by concatenating all these powerful arrays. Then, for each query, we need to compute the product of elements from index from_i to to_i in big_nums, modulo mod_i. But given the constraints, especially since from_i and to_i can be up to 1e15, we can't generate the big_nums array directly. We need a smarter way.

First, let's understand what the powerful array for a number x is. The powerful array is the shortest sorted array of powers of two that sum to x. For example, 11 is 8+2+1, so the array is [1,2,8]. Wait, but the array is sorted. So the powerful array is the binary representation of x, but sorted in ascending order. Because each power of two is present once if the bit is set. So for x, the powerful array is the list of 2^k where the k-th bit in x's binary representation is 1, sorted in increasing order. So for x=3 (binary 11), the array is [1,2]. For x=5 (101), it's [1,4].

So the big_nums array is formed by concatenating the powerful arrays of 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. So big_nums[1] is the first element of the powerful array of 1, which is [1], so big_nums[1] =1. Then big_nums[2] is the first element of the powerful array of 2, which is [2]. Then big_nums[3] is the first element of the powerful array of 3, which is [1,2], so the first element is 1. Then big_nums[4] is the first element of 4's array, which is [4], and so on. Wait, but the example given in the first example says that big_nums[1..3] is [2,1,2]. Wait, let me check the example again.

Wait, example 1 input is queries = [[1,3,7]], output is 4. The explanation says big_nums[1..3] is [2,1,2]. Wait, how? Let's see. The powerful array for 1 is [1], for 2 is [2], for 3 is [1,2]. So the big_nums is the concatenation of all elements of each powerful array. So for i=1, the powerful array is [1], so big_nums[1] =1. For i=2, the array is [2], so big_nums[2] =2. For i=3, the array is [1,2], so big_nums[3] =1, big_nums[4] =2. Then for i=4, the array is [4], so big_nums[5] =4. Wait, but the example says that from 1 to 3, the elements are [2,1,2]. That doesn't match. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the example says that big_nums starts as [1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 8, ...]. Let's see:

i=1: powerful array is [1] → elements added to big_nums: 1 → big_nums[1] =1.

i=2: powerful array is [2] → big_nums[2] =2.

i=3: powerful array is [1,2] → elements added: 1,2 → big_nums[3] =1, big_nums[4] =2.

i=4: powerful array is [4] → big_nums[5] =4.

i=5: powerful array is [1,4] → big_nums[6] =1, big_nums[7] =4.

i=6: powerful array is [2,4] → big_nums[8] =2, big_nums[9] =4.

i=7: powerful array is [1,2,4] → big_nums[10] =1, 11=2, 12=4.

So the big_nums array is:

index: 1 →1

2 →2

3 →1

4 →2

5 →4

6 →1

7 →4

8 →2

9 →4

10 →1

11 →2

12 →4

13 →8

So for example, the first example's query is from 1 to 3. So indexes 1,2,3. The elements are 1,2,1. Product is 1*2*1=2. But the example says the product is 4. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the example's output is 4. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the example says that big_nums[1..3] is [2,1,2]. How is that possible? Let me re-examine the example.

Wait, the first example's input is queries = [[1,3,7]], and the output is 4. The explanation says that big_nums[1..3] is [2,1,2]. So the product is 2*1*2=4 mod7 is 4. So how does that happen?

Wait, perhaps the big_nums is built by concatenating the powerful arrays in order, but each powerful array is added in order. So for i=1, the powerful array is [1], so big_nums[1] is 1. Then i=2, powerful array is [2], so big_nums[2] is 2. Then i=3, powerful array is [1,2], so big_nums[3] is 1, big_nums[4] is 2. Then i=4, powerful array is [4], so big_nums[5] is4. So the first three elements of big_nums are 1,2,1. But the example's explanation says that big_nums[1..3] is [2,1,2]. So there's a discrepancy here. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the big_nums is built by concatenating the powerful arrays for each i in order, but the indexes start at 1. Let me re-calculate:

i=1: powerful array is [1] → elements added: 1 → big_nums[1] =1.

i=2: powerful array is [2] → big_nums[2] =2.

i=3: powerful array is [1,2] → elements added: 1,2 → big_nums[3] =1, big_nums[4] =2.

i=4: powerful array is [4] → big_nums[5] =4.

i=5: powerful array is [1,4] → big_nums[6] =1, big_nums[7] =4.

So for the first example, the query is from 1 to 3. So indexes 1,2,3. The elements are 1,2,1. Product is 1*2*1=2. But the example's output is 4. So this suggests that my understanding is wrong.

Wait, the example's explanation says that big_nums[1..3] is [2,1,2]. How is that possible? Let's see. Maybe the indexes are 0-based? But the problem statement says "from_i, to_i" which are 1-based? Or perhaps the big_nums is built in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the powerful array for i is the array of elements in the order of the powers of two, but sorted in descending order. Wait, but the problem says the powerful array is the shortest sorted array. So sorted in ascending order. So for i=3, the array is [1,2]. So when concatenated, the elements are 1,2. So big_nums[3] is 1, big_nums[4] is 2.

But according to the example, the first three elements of big_nums are 2,1,2. So that's impossible. So perhaps the problem statement's example is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, let's re-examine the example 1:

Input: queries = [[1,3,7]]

Output: [4]

Explanation: big_nums[1..3] = [2,1,2]. The product is 2*1*2=4 mod7 is4.

So how is the big_nums array structured here? Let's see:

If the first three elements are 2,1,2, then the indexes 1,2,3 are 2,1,2.

But according to the problem statement, the big_nums is created by concatenating the powerful arrays for every positive integer i in ascending order. So for i=1, the array is [1], so big_nums[1] is 1. For i=2, the array is [2], so big_nums[2] is 2. For i=3, the array is [1,2], so big_nums[3] is 1, big_nums[4] is 2. So the first three elements are 1,2,1. But the example's explanation says they are 2,1,2. So there's a contradiction here.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement's example is wrong. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the powerful array is sorted in descending order. Let's check.

If the powerful array is sorted in descending order, then for i=3, the array is [2,1]. Then, when concatenated, the elements would be 2,1. So for i=3, the elements added are 2 and 1. So big_nums[3] is 2, big_nums[4] is 1. Then, the first three elements would be 1 (from i=1), 2 (i=2), 2 (i=3's first element). Then the product would be 1*2*2=4 mod7=4, which matches the example. So that's possible.

But the problem statement says the powerful array is the shortest sorted array. So sorted in which order? The example's explanation suggests that the array is sorted in descending order. But the problem statement says "shortest sorted array of powers of two that sum up to x". The shortest possible array would be the binary representation, which is sorted in ascending order. For example, 3 is 1+2, so the array is [1,2]. But if sorted in descending order, it's [2,1], which is the same length. So the problem statement's example must have a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the powerful array is the list of powers of two in the order of their exponents. For example, for x=3, the exponents are 0 and 1, so the array is [1,2]. For x=5 (101), exponents 0 and 2, so [1,4]. So the array is sorted in ascending order. So the example's explanation must be wrong. But that's not possible. So there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement's example is correct, and I'm missing something. Let's re-calculate the example.

In example 1, the query is from 1 to 3. The output is 4. The explanation says the product is 2*1*2=4. So the elements are 2,1,2. How can that be?

Let's see:

If the big_nums array is built as follows:

i=1: powerful array is [2], so big_nums[1] =2.

i=2: powerful array is [1], so big_nums[2] =1.

i=3: powerful array is [2], so big_nums[3] =2.

But that doesn't make sense. Because for i=1, the sum is 1, which is 2^0. So the powerful array is [1]. So why would the first element be 2?

Alternatively, perhaps the powerful array is the list of powers of two in the order of their exponents, but starting from the highest. For example, for x=3, the exponents are 0 and 1. So the array is [2,1]. Then, when concatenated, the elements are 2,1. So for i=3, the elements added are 2 and 1. So big_nums[3] is 2, big_nums[4] is 1.

Then, the big_nums array would be:

i=1: [1] → big_nums[1] =1.

i=2: [2] → big_nums[2] =2.

i=3: [2,1] → big_nums[3] =2, big_nums[4] =1.

i=4: [4] → big_nums[5] =4.

i=5: [4,1] → big_nums[6] =4, big_nums[7] =1.

i=6: [2,4] → big_nums[8] =2, big_nums[9] =4.

i=7: [4,2,1] → big_nums[10] =4, 11=2, 12=1.

But then, for the first example's query [1,3,7], the elements are 1,2,2. Product is 1*2*2=4 mod7=4. Which matches the example. So this would make sense. But the problem statement says the powerful array is the shortest sorted array. So sorted in which order? If sorted in descending order, then the array is the same length as the binary representation. So for x=3, the array is [2,1], which is sorted in descending order. But the problem statement says "sorted array of powers of two that sum up to x". So the order is not specified. But the example suggests that the array is sorted in descending order.

So the key here is that the powerful array is sorted in descending order. Then, the big_nums array is built by concatenating these arrays. So for each i, the powerful array is the list of powers of two in descending order. So for i=3, the array is [2,1], which when added to big_nums gives elements 2 and 1. So the first three elements of big_nums would be 1 (from i=1's array [1]), 2 (i=2's array [2]), 2 (i=3's array [2,1], first element). Then, the product of 1,2,2 is 4 mod7=4. Which matches the example.

So the problem statement's example is correct if the powerful array is sorted in descending order. But the problem statement says "shortest sorted array of powers of two that sum up to x". The shortest possible array is the binary representation, which is sorted in ascending order. But the example requires that the array is sorted in descending order. So there's a contradiction here.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement's example is wrong, but that's unlikely. So perhaps the problem statement's description is incorrect, and the powerful array is sorted in descending order. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the powerful array is the list of powers of two in the order of their exponents, but starting from the highest. For example, for x=3, the exponents are 0 and 1. So the highest is 1 (2^1=2), then 0 (2^0=1). So the array is [2,1]. So the powerful array is sorted in descending order of the exponents, which corresponds to the powers in descending order.

So the problem statement's example is correct if the powerful array is sorted in descending order. So the key is to generate the powerful array in descending order of the powers of two.

So the first step is to generate the powerful array for each x as the list of powers of two in descending order. Then, the big_nums array is the concatenation of all these arrays.

So for x=1: [1]

x=2: [2]

x=3: [2,1]

x=4: [4]

x=5: [4,1]

x=6: [4,2]

x=7: [4,2,1]

x=8: [8]

and so on.

So the big_nums array is built by concatenating all elements of each x's powerful array. So for x=1, the elements are [1]. x=2: [2]. x=3: [2,1]. x=4: [4]. x=5: [4,1]. x=6: [4,2]. x=7: [4,2,1]. x=8: [8], etc.

So the big_nums array would be:

x=1: 1 → index 1.

x=2: 2 → index 2.

x=3: 2,1 → indexes 3,4.

x=4:4 → index5.

x=5:4,1 → indexes6,7.

x=6:4,2 → indexes8,9.

x=7:4,2,1 → indexes10,11,12.

x=8:8 → index13.

So for example, the first example's query is from 1 to 3. The elements are 1 (x=1), 2 (x=2), 2 (x=3's first element). So product is 1*2*2=4 mod7=4. Which matches the example.

So the problem statement's example is correct if the powerful array is sorted in descending order. So the first step is to generate the powerful array for each x as the list of powers of two in descending order.

Now, the problem is to compute the product of elements in big_nums from from_i to to_i, modulo mod_i. But given that from_i and to_i can be up to 1e15, we can't generate the array. So we need a way to compute the product for a range of indices in big_nums without generating the array.

So the first thing is to model the big_nums array as a sequence of elements generated by the powerful arrays of each x, in order. Each x's powerful array is a list of powers of two in descending order. The length of the powerful array for x is equal to the number of set bits in x's binary representation. For example, x=3 (binary 11) has two set bits, so the array has two elements. x=5 (101) has two set bits, array has two elements. x=7 (111) has three set bits, array has three elements.

So for each x, the powerful array has k elements, where k is the number of set bits in x. The elements are 2^{b_1}, 2^{b_2}, ..., 2^{b_k}, where b_1 > b_2 > ... > b_k are the exponents of the set bits in x's binary representation.

So the big_nums array is a concatenation of all elements of the powerful arrays of x=1,2,3,4,... in order.

The problem is to find the product of elements in big_nums from index L to R (1-based), modulo M.

But with L and R up to 1e15, we need a way to compute this product efficiently.

The key is to model the big_nums array as a sequence of blocks, where each block corresponds to the elements of the powerful array of a certain x. Each block has a certain number of elements (equal to the number of set bits in x). The elements in the block are the powers of two in descending order.

So for example, x=3's block has two elements: 2,1.

The idea is to find which x's blocks are covered by the query's range [L, R], and then compute the product of the elements in those blocks that are within the query's range.

But even that might be challenging, given the size of x. So we need to find a way to model the positions in big_nums as a function of x and the position within the block.

Let's think about the cumulative number of elements up to x. Let's denote the cumulative count up to x as S(x) = sum_{i=1 to x} k_i, where k_i is the number of set bits in i's binary representation.

So S(x) is the total number of elements in big_nums up to and including x's block.

For example:

x=1: k_1=1 → S(1)=1.

x=2: k_2=1 → S(2)=2.

x=3: k_3=2 → S(3)=4.

x=4: k_4=1 → S(4)=5.

x=5: k_5=2 → S(5)=7.

x=6: k_6=2 → S(6)=9.

x=7: k_7=3 → S(7)=12.

x=8: k_8=1 → S(8)=13.

So the cumulative sum S(x) can be used to find which x's block contains a certain position in big_nums.

But how to compute S(x) efficiently for large x? Because x can be up to 1e15, and we need to find for a given position in big_nums, which x's block it belongs to.

But even computing S(x) for x up to 1e15 is challenging. However, the sum S(x) is the sum of the number of set bits in each number from 1 to x. This is a known problem. The sum of set bits from 1 to x can be computed using a formula based on the binary representation of x.

The sum of set bits from 1 to x can be calculated as follows:

For each bit position, count the number of times it is set in numbers from 1 to x. Summing over all bits gives the total.

The formula for the number of set bits in the numbers from 0 to x-1 is known. For example, for a bit at position k (starting from 0), the number of times it is set is (x >> (k+1)) << k) + max(0, (x & ((1 << (k+1)) -1)) - (1 << k) + 1).

But since we need the sum from 1 to x, we can compute the sum from 0 to x and subtract the sum for 0 (which is 0).

So the sum S(x) is the sum of the number of set bits in each number from 1 to x. Let's denote this as sum_bits(x).

So sum_bits(x) = sum_{i=1 to x} (number of set bits in i).

Once we can compute sum_bits(x) efficiently, we can use binary search to find the x such that sum_bits(x-1) < L <= sum_bits(x). This x is the block that contains the L-th element of big_nums.

But even with that, for a query [L, R], we need to find all x's such that their blocks overlap with [L, R], and then compute the product of the elements in those overlapping parts.

But how to model the elements in the blocks. Each x's block has k elements (number of set bits in x), and the elements are 2^{b_1}, 2^{b_2}, ..., 2^{b_k}, where b_1 > b_2 > ... > b_k.

So for x, the elements in the block are the powers of two corresponding to the set bits in x's binary representation, in descending order.

For example, x=5 (binary 101) has set bits at positions 0 and 2. So the elements are 4 (2^2) and 1 (2^0), so the block is [4,1].

So the elements in the block for x are 2^b for each set bit b in x, sorted in descending order of b.

So the elements in the block can be determined by the positions of the set bits in x's binary representation.

Now, the problem is to compute the product of elements in the big_nums array from L to R, modulo M.

But given that L and R can be up to 1e15, and the number of queries is up to 500, we need an efficient way to compute this product.

The approach would be:

1. For each query [L, R, M], compute the product of elements from L to R in big_nums, modulo M.

2. To compute this product, we need to find all the x's whose blocks contribute elements to the range [L, R], and for each such x, determine which elements of their block are within [L, R], and multiply them into the product.

But how to do this efficiently.

First, for a given L and R, we need to find all x's such that their block contains at least one element in [L, R]. For each such x, we need to find the start and end indices of their block's elements that are within [L, R], and compute the product of those elements.

But even this approach could be time-consuming for large ranges. So we need a way to model the product for each x's block and compute the product for the overlapping elements.

But given that M can be up to 1e5, and the product can be very large, we need to compute the product modulo M as we go.

So the steps for a single query [L, R, M] would be:

a. Find the first x such that the start of x's block is <= L. This can be done using binary search on x to find the x where sum_bits(x-1) < L <= sum_bits(x). Similarly for the end x where sum_bits(x) >= R.

b. For each x in the range from x_start to x_end, determine the elements in their block that are within [L, R], and compute their product modulo M.

But how to compute the product for each x's block's elements that are in the query's range.

But even this approach may not be feasible for large x ranges. For example, if L=1 and R=1e15, then x_start=1 and x_end=1e15, which is impossible to iterate through.

So we need a way to compute the product for all x's in a certain range, but in O(1) or O(log x) time per x.

But how?

Alternative approach: For each x, the elements in the block are 2^b_1, 2^b_2, ..., 2^b_k, where b_1 > b_2 > ... > b_k. The product of these elements is 2^{sum(b_i)}. Because when you multiply exponents with the same base, you add the exponents. For example, 2^a * 2^b = 2^(a+b). So the product of the elements in x's block is 2^{sum of exponents in x's set bits}.

Wait, but the exponents are the positions of the set bits. For example, x=3 (binary 11) has exponents 0 and 1. Sum is 0+1=1. So product is 2^1=2. But the elements are 2 and 1, product is 2*1=2. Which matches.

x=5 (binary 101) exponents 0 and 2. Sum is 0+2=2. Product is 4*1=4=2^2.

x=7 (binary 111) exponents 0,1,2. Sum is 3. Product is 4*2*1=8=2^3.

So yes, the product of the elements in x's block is 2^{sum of exponents of set bits in x}.

But wait, the exponents are the positions of the set bits. For example, x=6 (binary 110) has exponents 1 and 2. Sum is 3. Product is 4*2=8=2^3.

Yes. So the product of the elements in x's block is 2^{sum of exponents of set bits in x}.

So for any x, the product of its block's elements is 2^{sum of exponents of set bits in x}.

But how does this help us? Because the query's range may cover only a subset of the elements in x's block.

For example, if the query's range starts at the second element of x's block and ends at the third element, then we need to multiply only those two elements.

But if we can model the product of a subset of the elements in x's block, then we can compute it as the product of a portion of the elements.

But how?

The elements in x's block are ordered in descending order of exponents. So for x's block, the elements are 2^b_1, 2^b_2, ..., 2^b_k, where b_1 > b_2 > ... > b_k.

The product of the first m elements is 2^{b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_m}.

The product of elements from position s to e in the block is 2^{sum_{i=s}^e b_i}.

But how to compute this sum for a given s and e.

But the sum of exponents from s to e in the block is the sum of the exponents of the set bits in x, minus the sum of the exponents not included (those before s-1 and after e).

Wait, no. The exponents in the block are ordered in descending order. So the first element is the highest exponent, then the next, etc.

So for example, x=5 (binary 101) has exponents 2 and 0. The block is [4,1]. The sum of exponents is 2+0=2. The product is 4*1=4=2^2.

If the query's range includes the first element (4) and the second (1), the product is 4*1=4. If the range includes only the first element, the product is 4. If the range includes the second element, the product is 1.

So for a given x's block, if the query's range includes elements from position a to b in the block, then the product is the product of elements a to b in the block.

But how to compute this product.

The product of elements a to b in the block is 2^{sum of exponents from a to b}.

But the exponents are ordered in descending order. So the sum of exponents from a to b is the sum of the exponents of the set bits in x, minus the sum of the exponents of the first (a-1) bits and the sum of the exponents of the bits after the b-th position.

Wait, no. The exponents in the block are ordered in descending order. So the first element is the largest exponent, the second is the next largest, etc.

So for example, x=7 (binary 111) has exponents 2,1,0. The block is [4,2,1]. The sum of exponents is 3. The product is 8.

If the query's range includes the first two elements (4 and 2), the product is 4*2=8=2^3. The sum of exponents is 2+1=3.

If the range includes the first and third elements (4 and 1), the product is 4*1=4=2^2. Sum of exponents is 2+0=2.

So the sum of exponents for the elements a to b in the block is the sum of the exponents of the first a-1 elements plus the sum of the exponents of the elements from a to b.

Wait, no. The sum of exponents from a to b is the sum of the exponents of the elements in positions a to b in the block.

But the exponents are ordered in descending order. So the sum is the sum of the exponents of the set bits in x, but only for the elements in positions a to b.

But how to compute this sum.

Alternatively, the sum of exponents for the elements in positions a to b of x's block is equal to the sum of the exponents of the set bits in x, minus the sum of the exponents of the first (a-1) set bits and the sum of the exponents of the set bits after the b-th position.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, for x's block, the exponents are sorted in descending order. So the exponents are b_1, b_2, ..., b_k, where b_1 > b_2 > ... > b_k.

The sum of exponents from a to b is sum_{i=a}^b b_i.

But how to compute this sum for a given a and b.

But for a given x, the exponents are known. So for example, if x's binary representation is known, the exponents can be determined, sorted in descending order, and then the sum from a to b can be computed.

But for large x, this is not feasible. So we need a way to compute the sum of exponents from a to b in x's block without explicitly enumerating the exponents.

But how?

Alternatively, the sum of exponents from a to b in x's block is equal to the sum of all exponents in x minus the sum of the first (a-1) exponents and the sum of the exponents from (b+1) to k.

But again, this requires knowing the exponents in order.

Hmm. This seems challenging.

Alternative approach: For each x, the exponents in the block are the positions of the set bits in x's binary representation, sorted in descending order. So the exponents are the same as the positions of the set bits, but sorted in reverse order.

So for x, the exponents are sorted in descending order. So the sum of exponents from a to b in the block is the sum of the a-th to b-th largest exponents in x's binary representation.

But how to compute this sum.

For example, x=5 (binary 101) has exponents 2 and 0. The block is [4,1]. The sum from a=1 to b=1 is 2. Sum from a=1 to b=2 is 2+0=2. Sum from a=2 to b=2 is 0.

So for a given x, the sum of exponents from a to b in the block is the sum of the a-th to b-th largest exponents in x's binary representation.

But how to compute this sum without enumerating all exponents.

This seems difficult. So perhaps we need to find a way to model the exponents for x and compute the sum for a given a and b.

But given that x can be up to 1e15, and the number of queries is up to 500, this approach may not be feasible.

Alternative idea: For each x, the exponents are the positions of the set bits in x's binary representation. So the sum of exponents is the sum of the positions of the set bits. For example, x=5 (101) has sum 2+0=2.

The sum of exponents from a to b in the block is the sum of the a-th to b-th largest exponents. So for x=5, the exponents are [2,0]. The sum from a=1 to b=1 is 2. From a=1 to b=2 is 2+0=2. From a=2 to b=2 is 0.

So the sum can be computed as the sum of the a-th to b-th elements in the sorted list of exponents in descending order.

But how to compute this sum without storing the exponents.

Alternative approach: For a given x, the exponents are the positions of the set bits. Let's denote the exponents as a list sorted in descending order. The sum from a to b is the sum of the elements from index a-1 to b-1 in this list.

But how to compute this sum without explicitly generating the list.

This seems challenging. So perhaps we need to find a way to model the exponents for x and compute the sum for a given a and b.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the only feasible way is to precompute for each x the list of exponents in descending order, but for x up to 1e15, this is impossible.

So perhaps we need to find a mathematical way to compute the sum of the a-th to b-th largest exponents in x's binary representation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the exponents as a list and find a way to compute the sum for a given a and b.

But I'm not sure.

Alternative idea: For a given x, the exponents are the positions of the set bits. Let's say x has k set bits. The exponents are sorted in descending order. The sum of exponents from a to b is the sum of the exponents in positions a to b in this sorted list.

But how to compute this sum.

For example, x=7 (binary 111) has exponents 2,1,0. The sum from a=1 to b=2 is 2+1=3.

But how to compute this sum without storing the exponents.

Hmm. This seems difficult.

Alternative approach: For each x, the exponents are the positions of the set bits. The sum of exponents from a to b in the block is the sum of the a-th to b-th largest exponents. So for x, the sum is the sum of the exponents of the set bits, but only the largest (a-1) exponents are excluded, and the smallest (k - b) exponents are excluded.

Wait, no. For example, if a=2 and b=3 in a block of 5 elements, then we take the 2nd to 3rd elements. But the exponents are sorted in descending order. So the sum is the sum of the exponents in positions 2 and 3.

But how to compute this sum.

Alternatively, the sum of exponents from a to b is equal to the total sum of exponents minus the sum of the first (a-1) exponents and the sum of the exponents from (b+1) to k.

But again, this requires knowing the sum of the first (a-1) exponents and the sum of the exponents after b.

But how to compute these sums.

This seems like a dead end.

Alternative idea: For each x, the exponents are the positions of the set bits. The sum of exponents from a to b in the block is the sum of the exponents of the set bits, but only those that are in the a-th to b-th positions when sorted in descending order.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum can be computed using the binary representation of x. For example, the exponents are the positions of the set bits. So for x=5 (101), the exponents are 2 and 0. The sum from a=1 to b=1 is 2. From a=1 to b=2 is 2+0=2. From a=2 to b=2 is 0.

But how to compute this sum for a given a and b.

Another example: x=6 (110) has exponents 2 and 1. The sum from a=1 to b=1 is 2. From a=1 to b=2 is 2+1=3. From a=2 to b=2 is 1.

So the sum depends on the positions of the set bits and their order.

But how to compute this sum without enumerating the exponents.

This seems challenging.

Alternative approach: For each x, the exponents are the positions of the set bits. The sum of exponents from a to b in the block is the sum of the exponents of the set bits that are in the a-th to b-th positions when sorted in descending order.

But how to compute this sum.

Perhaps we can model the exponents as a list and find a way to compute the sum for a given a and b.

But for x up to 1e15, this is not feasible.

So perhaps the problem requires a different approach.

Let's think differently. The product of elements in the big_nums array from L to R is the product of all elements in the blocks of x's that are completely contained within [L, R], multiplied by the product of the elements in the partial blocks at the start and end.

But even this approach requires finding the x's that are completely contained and the partial ones.

But how to compute the product for the complete blocks.

For a complete block (i.e., the entire block is within [L, R]), the product is 2^{sum of exponents of x}.

For partial blocks, the product is 2^{sum of exponents from a to b in x's block}.

But again, the problem is how to compute the sum of exponents from a to b in x's block.

But perhaps there's a pattern or mathematical formula that can be derived.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of exponents from a to b in x's block can be computed as the sum of the exponents of the set bits in x, minus the sum of the exponents of the first (a-1) set bits and the sum of the exponents of the set bits after the b-th position.

But how to compute these sums.

Alternatively, the sum of exponents from a to b in x's block is equal to the sum of all exponents of x's set bits minus the sum of the exponents of the first (a-1) set bits and the sum of the exponents of the set bits after the b-th position.

But again, this requires knowing the order of the exponents.

This seems like a dead end.

Alternative idea: For a given x, the exponents are the positions of the set bits. The sum of exponents from a to b in the block is the sum of the exponents of the set bits that are in the a-th to b-th positions when sorted in descending order.

But for x up to 1e15, this is not feasible.

So perhaps the problem requires a different approach.

Let's think about the product modulo M. Since M can be up to 1e5, and the product can be very large, we need to compute the product modulo M as we go.

But even this doesn't help with the problem of finding the sum of exponents for partial blocks.

Alternative approach: For each query, we can model the big_nums array as a sequence of elements generated by the powerful arrays of x's. For each x, the elements are 2^b_1, 2^b_2, ..., 2^b_k, where b_1 > b_2 > ... > b_k are the exponents of the set bits in x.

The product of elements from L to R is the product of all elements in the blocks that are covered by [L, R], multiplied by the product of the elements in the partial blocks.

But how to compute this product.

But even this approach requires knowing which x's are covered and which elements of their blocks are in the query's range.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the only feasible way is to precompute for each x the sum of exponents and the product of the elements in the block, and then use binary search to find the x's that are completely contained in the query's range, and compute their product contribution. For the partial blocks, we need to compute the product of the elements in the overlapping part.

But how to compute the product for the overlapping part.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of the elements in the overlapping part can be computed as the product of the elements in the block divided by the product of the elements not in the overlapping part. But since we are working modulo M, division is not straightforward unless M is prime and the divisor is coprime with M.

But this approach may not be feasible.

So perhaps the problem requires a different approach.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the only way is to model the problem as follows:

For each query [L, R, M], we need to find all x's such that their block contains at least one element in [L, R]. For each such x, we need to find the start and end indices of their block's elements that are within [L, R], and compute the product of those elements modulo M.

But how to compute this product for each x.

For x's block, the elements are 2^b_1, 2^b_2, ..., 2^b_k, where b_1 > b_2 > ... > b_k.

The product of elements from position s to e in the block is 2^{sum_{i=s}^e b_i}.

But how to compute sum_{i=s}^e b_i.

But sum_{i=s}^e b_i is the sum of the exponents of the set bits in x, but only those that are in the s-th to e-th positions in the sorted list of exponents in descending order.

But how to compute this sum.

This seems like the crux of the problem.

For the partial blocks, we need to compute the product of the elements in the overlapping part.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the only way is to precompute for each x the sum of exponents and the product of the elements in the block, and then use binary search to find the x's that are completely contained in the query's range, and compute their product contribution. For the partial blocks, we need to compute the product of the elements in the overlapping part.

But how to compute the product for the overlapping part.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of the elements in the overlapping part can be computed as the product of the elements in the block divided by the product of the elements not in the overlapping part. But since we are working modulo M, division is not straightforward unless M is prime and the divisor is coprime with M.

But this approach may not be feasible.

So perhaps the problem requires a different approach.

Let's think about the following:

But how to compute this product.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the only way is to model the problem as follows:

For each query [L, R, M], we need to find all x's such that their block contains at least one element in [L, R]. For each such x, we need to find the start and end indices of their block's elements that are within [L, R], and compute the product of those elements modulo M.

But how to compute this product for each x.

For x's block, the elements are 2^b_1, 2^b_2, ..., 2^b_k, where b_1 > b_2 > ... > b_k.

The product of elements from position s to e in the block is 2^{sum_{i=s}^e b_i}.

But how to compute sum_{i=s}^e b_i.

But sum_{i=s}^e b_i is the sum of the exponents of the set bits in x, but only those that are in the s-th to e-th positions in the sorted list of exponents in descending order.

But how to compute this sum.

This seems like the crux of the problem.

Alternative idea: For a given x, the exponents are the positions of the set bits. The sum of exponents from s to e in the block is the sum of the exponents of the set bits that are in the s-th to e-th positions when sorted in descending order.

But how to compute this sum.

Perhaps we can model the exponents as a list and find a way to compute the sum for a given s and e.

But for x up to 1e15, this is not feasible.

For each query [L, R, M], we need to find all x's such that their block contains at least one element in [L, R]. For each such x, we need to find the start and end indices of their block's elements that are within [L, R], and compute the product of those elements modulo M.

But how to compute this product for each x.

For x's block, the elements are 2^b_1, 2^b_2, ..., 2^b_k, where b_1 > b_2 > ... > b_k.

The product of elements from position s to e in the block is 2^{sum_{i=s}^e b_i}.

But how to compute sum_{i=s}^e b_i.

But sum_{i=s}^e b_i is the sum of the exponents of the set bits in x, but only those that are in the s-th to e-th positions in the sorted list of exponents in descending order.

But how to compute this sum.

This seems like the crux of the problem.

Alternative idea: For a given x, the exponents are the positions of the set bits. The sum of exponents from s to e in the block is the sum of the exponents of the set bits that are in the s-th to e-th positions when sorted in descending order.

But how to compute this sum.

Perhaps we can model the exponents as a list and find a way to compute the sum for a given s and e.

But for x up to 1e15, this is not feasible.

So perhaps the problem requires a different approach.

Let's think about the following:

The product of elements in the big_nums array from L to R is the product of all elements in the blocks of x's that are covered by [L, R], multiplied by the product of the elements in the partial blocks.

But how to compute this product.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the only way is to precompute for each x the sum of exponents and the product of the elements in the block, and then use binary search to find the x's that are completely contained in the query's range, and compute their product contribution. For the partial blocks, we need to compute the product of the elements in the overlapping part.

But how to compute the product for the overlapping part.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of the elements in the overlapping part can be computed as the product of the elements in the block divided by the product of the elements not in the overlapping part. But since we are working modulo M, division is not straightforward unless M is prime and the divisor is coprime with M.

But this approach may not be feasible.
