Okay, let's see. The problem is about Alice and Bob playing a game where they keep appending the next characters of the current string. We need to find the k-th character after enough operations so that the word has at least k characters. Hmm.

So the initial word is "a". Each operation, Bob takes the current word, shifts each character to the next in the alphabet (with z wrapping around to a), and appends that to the original word. Wait, wait. Wait, the example says that when you perform the operation on "c", you get "cd". So the original word is "c", then the new string is generated by changing each character (so 'c' becomes 'd'), and then append that to the original. So after the operation, the new word is "c" + "d" = "cd"? Or wait, maybe the operation is: the new string is generated by changing each character in the current word, and then appending that new string to the original word. So for example, initial word is "a". After first operation: the new string is "b" (since each character in "a" is shifted to next, which is 'b'), then append to original, so the new word is "ab". Then next operation: take "ab", shift each character to next (so 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c'), so the new string is "bc", append to original, making "abbc". Then next operation: shift each character in "abbc" to next. 'a'→'b', 'b'→'c', 'b'→'c', 'c'→'d' → "bccd", append to original, so new word is "abbcbccd". 

So the process is: each step, the current word is S, then generate S' by shifting each character in S, then the new word is S + S'. 

Wait, but the example for k=5: after three operations, the word is "abbcbccd" which has length 1 + 2 +4 = 7? Let's check the example. 

In example 1, k=5. The initial word is "a" (length 1). After first operation, append "b" → length 2. Second operation, append "bc" → length 4. Third operation, append "bccd" → length 8. Wait, but the example says after three operations, the word is "abbcbccd" which is 8 characters. But the explanation says that after three operations, the word is "abbcbccd". So the example's explanation says that after each operation, the new string is added. So each operation increases the length of the word by the current length. Because the first operation adds a string of length 1 (original length 1), so new length is 1+1=2. Second operation adds a string of length 2 (original is 2), so new length is 2+2=4. Third operation adds a string of length 4, so new length is 4+4=8. So after three operations, the length is 8. But the example says that after three operations, the word is "abbcbccd" which is 8 characters. So the k=5th character is the 5th in that string, which is 'b'.

So the problem is to model how each character in the k-th position is determined based on the operations.

But simulating this directly for large k (up to 500) would be computationally expensive. Because each step the length doubles (if the previous step's length is L, then the new length is L + L = 2L). Wait, no. Wait, the first step: initial length is 1. After first operation, the new string is generated by shifting each character (so length 1) and appending to original. So new length is 1 + 1 = 2. Then next operation: the current word is length 2. Generate the next string by shifting each character (length 2), append to original. So new length is 2 + 2 =4. Then next step: 4 +4=8, then 8+8=16, etc. So each step the length doubles. So after n operations, the length is 2^n. Wait, initial length is 1. After 0 operations, length is 1. After 1 operation, 2. After 2, 4. After 3, 8. So after m operations, the length is 2^m. Wait, but the initial word is "a" (length 1). So after m operations, the length is 1 * 2^m. Because each operation doubles the length. So for example, after 3 operations, 1*2^3=8. Which matches the example.

But k can be up to 500. So 2^m >=k. So m is the minimal integer such that 2^m >=k. For example, k=5: 2^3=8 >=5. So m=3. So the number of operations needed is the minimal m where 2^m >=k. Wait, but the problem says "after enough operations have been done for word to have at least k characters". So the number of operations is the minimal m such that the length after m operations is >=k. But the length after m operations is 2^m. So m is the ceiling of log2(k). Wait, for k=5, log2(5) is ~2.32, so m=3. So the number of operations is m.

But how to model the k-th character. Because each operation appends a new part. So the word after m operations is a sequence of parts. Each part is generated by shifting the previous part and appending. So the first part is "a". Then after first operation, the word is "a" + "b". Then after second operation, it's "ab" + "bc". Then after third, "abbc" + "bccd", etc. So each step, the new part is the shifted version of the previous part.

But the k-th character is in one of the parts. For example, in the first example, k=5. The word after 3 operations is "abbcbccd". The positions are 0-based or 1-based? The example says the 5th character is 'b'. Let's see: the string is a b b c b c c d. So positions 0-7. The 5th (if 1-based) is index 4 (0-based) which is 'b'. So the example uses 1-based indexing. So the problem says "the k-th character", which is 1-based.

So the approach is to find which part of the word the k-th character is in, and then compute the character based on the shifts applied in each step.

But how to model the shifts. Let's think recursively. Each part is generated by shifting the previous part. So the first part is "a". The second part is "b" (shifted 'a'). The third part is "bc" (shifted "ab" → each character shifted once). Wait, no. Wait, the second part is generated by shifting the first part. The third part is generated by shifting the entire word up to that point. Wait, no. Let's re-examine the process.

Each operation is: take the current word, generate a new string by shifting each character, then append that new string to the original word. So after each operation, the new word is the original word plus the shifted version of the original word.

So the first operation: original is "a". Shifted is "b". New word is "ab".

Second operation: original is "ab". Shifted is "bc". New word is "ab" + "bc" = "abbc".

Third operation: original is "abbc". Shifted is "bccd". New word is "abbc" + "bccd" = "abbcbccd".

So each new part is the shifted version of the entire current word before the operation. So each part is the shifted version of the previous entire word.

But the parts are added in a way that each new part is the shifted version of the entire word up to that point. So the first part is "a". Then the second part is "b" (shifted "a"). Then the third part is "bc" (shifted "ab"). Then the fourth part is "bccd" (shifted "abbc"), etc.

But the problem is that each new part is the shifted version of the entire current word. So the length of each part doubles each time. Because the first part is length 1. The second part is length 1. The third part is length 2. The fourth part is length 4. The fifth part is length 8, etc. Wait, no. Let's see:

After 0 operations: word is "a" (length 1). Part 1: "a".

After 1 operation: word is "ab" (parts: "a", "b"). Part 2: "b" (length 1).

After 2 operations: word is "abbc" (parts: "a", "b", "bc"). Part 3: "bc" (length 2).

After 3 operations: word is "abbcbccd" (parts: "a", "b", "bc", "bccd"). Part 4: "bccd" (length 4).

So each new part has length equal to the length of the word before the operation. Because the operation takes the current word (length L), shifts each character (so new string of length L), appends to the original. So the new word's length is L + L = 2L. So each part's length is L, where L is the length of the word before the operation. So the parts are:

Part 1: length 1 (original "a")

Part 2: length 1 (shifted "a")

Part 3: length 2 (shifted "ab")

Part 4: length 4 (shifted "abbc")

Part 5: length 8 (shifted "abbcbccd")

And so on.

So the total length after m operations is 1 + 1 + 2 +4 +8 + ... + 2^{m-2} } ?

Wait, let's see. Let's model the parts:

After 0 operations: part 1 (length 1). Total length 1.

After 1 operation: part 2 (length 1). Total length 1+1=2.

After 2 operations: part 3 (length 2). Total length 2+2=4.

After 3 operations: part 4 (length 4). Total length 4+4=8.

After m operations: part m+1 (length 2^{m-1} ). Total length is 2^m.

So the total length after m operations is 2^m. So for k=5, m=3 (since 2^3=8 >=5). So the parts up to m=3 are parts 1,2,3,4. Their lengths are 1,1,2,4. Summing to 8.

So the k-th character is in one of these parts. For example, k=5 is in part 4 (since 1+1+2=4, so part 4 starts at position 5 (1-based) and has length 4. So the 5th character is the first character of part 4.

But how to find which part the k-th character is in. Let's model the parts and their cumulative lengths.

The parts are:

Part 1: length 1 → cumulative sum after part 1: 1.

Part 2: length 1 → cumulative sum after part 2: 2.

Part 3: length 2 → cumulative sum after part 3: 4.

Part 4: length 4 → cumulative sum after part 4: 8.

Part m: length 2^{m-2} → cumulative sum after part m: 2^{m-1}.

Wait, part 1 is m=0? Or perhaps the parts are numbered starting from 1. Let's see:

After 0 operations, the word is part 1 (length 1).

After 1 operation, part 2 (length 1) is added. Total length 2.

After 2 operations, part 3 (length 2) is added. Total length 4.

So part m is added after (m-1) operations. So the number of parts is m+1 after m operations.

But perhaps it's easier to model the parts as levels. Each level m (starting from 0) has a part of length 2^m. Wait, no. Let's see:

Part 1 (after 0 operations) is length 1 = 2^0.

Part 2 (after 1 operation) is length 1 = 2^0.

Part 3 (after 2 operations) is length 2 = 2^1.

Part 4 (after 3 operations) is length 4 = 2^2.

Part 5 (after 4 operations) is length 8 = 2^3.

So part m (where m starts at 1) has length 2^{m-2} for m >=2. Wait, part 3 is m=3, length 2^1=2. Part 4 is m=4, length 2^2=4. So part m (for m >=2) has length 2^{m-2}.

But perhaps a better way is to model the parts as follows: the first part is level 0, length 1. Then each subsequent level adds a part of length equal to the sum of all previous parts. Wait, no. Because the first part is 1. The second part is 1 (sum of previous parts is 1, so 1). The third part is 2 (sum of previous parts is 2). The fourth part is 4 (sum of previous parts is 4). So each part's length is equal to the sum of all previous parts. Because the sum after part 1 is 1. Part 2's length is 1 (sum of previous parts is 1). Part 3's length is 2 (sum of previous parts is 1+1=2). Part 4's length is 4 (sum of previous parts is 1+1+2=4). So each part's length is equal to the sum of all previous parts. So the sum after part m is 2^m.

But how to model this. Let's see:

sum_0 = 1 (part 1)

sum_1 = sum_0 + 1 = 2 (part 2)

sum_2 = sum_1 + 2 =4 (part 3)

sum_3 = sum_2 +4=8 (part4)

sum_4= sum_3 +8=16 (part5)

So sum_m = 2^{m}.

So the sum after m parts is 2^m. So the parts are added in such a way that each part's length is sum_{i=0}^{m-1} 1} = 2^{m-1} ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think again. The first part is 1. The second part is 1. The third part is 2. The fourth part is 4. The fifth part is 8. So the parts are 1,1,2,4,8,16,... which is 2^0, 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, etc. So the first two parts are 2^0, then each subsequent part is 2^{n} where n starts at 1.

But how to find which part the k-th character is in. Let's see. The cumulative sum after each part is:

After part 1: 1.

After part 2: 2.

After part 3: 4.

After part 4: 8.

After part m: 2^{m-1}.

So for example, part 1 is sum 1, part 2 sum 2, part3 sum4, etc.

So the k-th character is in the part where the cumulative sum first exceeds or equals k.

Wait, no. Because the parts are added in order. So the first part is 1 character. The second part is 1, so positions 2. The third part is 2, positions 3-4. The fourth part is 4, positions 5-8. So for k=5, it's in part4.

So the approach is to find the smallest m such that the sum of the first m parts is >=k. But the sum of the first m parts is 2^{m-1}.

Wait, sum after m parts is 2^{m-1}.

Wait, for m=1: sum is 1=2^0.

m=2: sum 2=2^1.

m=3: sum4=2^2.

m=4: sum8=2^3.

So sum after m parts is 2^{m-1}.

So to find the part where the k-th character is, we need to find the smallest m where 2^{m-1} >=k.

Wait, but for example, k=5. 2^{m-1} >=5. So m-1 >=3 (since 2^3=8 >=5). So m=4. So the part is m=4. But the sum after part4 is 8, which is >=5. So the part is m=4. But the parts are numbered starting from 1. So part4 is the fourth part. But how to model this.

Alternatively, the part number can be determined by finding the highest power of two that is less than k. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think of the parts as levels. The first two parts (sum 1 and 2) are level 0 and 1. Then each subsequent part is level m, with sum 2^m.

Wait, perhaps the part number can be determined by the position in the binary representation of k. For example, k=5 is 101 in binary. The highest power is 4 (2^2). So the part is level 2, which is part4. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the part where the k-th character is located is determined by the highest power of two less than or equal to (k-1). Let's see:

For k=5, k-1=4. The highest power of two <=4 is 4 (2^2). So the part is level 2. But how does that map to the part number.

Alternatively, the part number is m, where m is the position of the highest set bit in (k-1). For example, k=5, k-1=4 (binary 100). The highest set bit is at position 2 (0-based), so m=3 (since 2^2 is 4, and part m=3 is the part with length 4). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the part number can be found by finding the largest t such that 2^{t} <k. Then the part is t+1. For example, k=5: 2^2=4 <5, so t=2, part is 3. But part3 has sum 4, which is less than 5. So that's not correct.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is getting stuck. Let's think differently. The k-th character is in the part that is added in the m-th operation, where m is the number of operations needed to reach a word of length >=k. But the number of operations is the minimal m where 2^m >=k. For example, k=5: m=3 (since 2^3=8 >=5). So after 3 operations, the word is 8 characters. So the parts are up to part4 (since after 3 operations, 4 parts have been added). So the parts are 1,2,3,4. The sum after part4 is 8.

So the k-th character is in part4. But how to find which part it's in.

The parts are:

Part1: 1 character (sum 1)

Part2: 1 (sum 2)

Part3: 2 (sum4)

Part4:4 (sum8)

So for k=5, the sum after part3 is4, which is less than5. So the part4 is the one that contains the 5th character.

So the part number is the minimal m where the sum of the first m parts is >=k. But the sum of the first m parts is 2^{m-1}.

So to find m, we need to find the smallest m where 2^{m-1} >=k. For example, k=5: 2^{3-1}=4 <5. 2^{4-1}=8 >=5. So m=4. So the part is part4.

But how to compute m. For a given k, m is the ceiling of log2(k) +1? Or perhaps m is the position of the highest set bit in (k) plus 1. For example, k=5 is 101. The highest set bit is at position 2 (0-based), so 2+1=3. But m=4. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, m is the number of bits in the binary representation of k. For example, k=5 is 101, which is 3 bits. So m=3. But 2^{3-1}=4 <5. So that's not correct.

Alternatively, m is the position where 2^{m-1} is the first power of two >=k. For example, for k=5, 2^3=8 is the first power >=5. So m-1=3 → m=4.

So m is the exponent such that 2^{m-1} >=k. So m-1 is the ceiling of log2(k). So m=ceil(log2(k)) +1. Wait, no. For example, k=5: log2(5) is ~2.32. Ceiling is 3. So m-1=3 → m=4. Which is correct.

So m=ceil(log2(k)) +1? Wait, no. Because m-1=ceil(log2(k)), so m=ceil(log2(k)) +1. For example, k=5: ceil(log2(5))=3 → m=4. Which is correct.

But how to compute this in code. For example, in Python, we can compute the bit length. For k=5, the binary is 101, which has 3 bits. So the bit length is 3. So ceil(log2(k)) is 3. So m=3+1=4. Which is correct.

So the part number is m= (bit length of (k-1)) +1. Wait, for k=5, k-1=4 (100), bit length is3. So 3+1=4. Which is correct.

Alternatively, the part number is the bit length of (k) when written in binary. For example, k=5 is 101, bit length 3. So part number is3. But that's not correct. Because part3 has sum4, which is less than5.

Hmm, perhaps the part number is the bit length of (k) minus 1. For example, k=5: bit length is3, minus1 is2. So part2. But part2's sum is2, which is less than5. So that's not correct.

Alternatively, the part number is the bit length of (k) plus 1. For example, k=5: 3+1=4. Which is correct.

So the part number is the bit length of (k) when written in binary. For example, 5 is 101 (3 bits), so part3. But part3's sum is4, which is less than5. So that's not correct.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is not working. Let's think of the parts as layers. Each part is a layer, and the layers are added in such a way that each layer's length is equal to the sum of all previous layers. So the first layer is 1, sum 1. Second layer is 1, sum 2. Third layer is 2, sum4. Fourth layer is4, sum8. Fifth layer is8, sum16. Etc.

So the sum after m layers is 2^{m-1}.

So for a given k, the layer (part) that contains the k-th character is the smallest m where 2^{m-1} >=k. For example, k=5: 2^{3} =8 >=5. So m=4. So the part is layer4.

But how to find m. For example, m is the smallest integer such that 2^{m-1} >=k. So m-1 is the ceiling of log2(k). So m=ceil(log2(k)) +1. For example, k=5: log2(5) is ~2.32, ceiling is3. m=3+1=4. Correct.

So once we find m, the part is layer m. Then, the position within the part is k - sum of previous layers. Sum of previous layers is 2^{m-2} (since sum after m-1 layers is 2^{m-2}).

Wait, sum after m-1 layers is 2^{(m-1)-1} =2^{m-2}. So the starting index of layer m is 2^{m-2} +1. The length of layer m is 2^{m-2} (since sum after m layers is 2^{m-1} = sum after m-1 layers + 2^{m-2} → sum after m-1 layers is 2^{m-2} → sum after m layers is 2^{m-2} + 2^{m-2} = 2^{m-1}).

So the starting index of layer m is 2^{m-2} +1. The ending index is 2^{m-1}.

So for example, layer4 (m=4) starts at 2^{4-2} +1=4+1=5, ends at 8. So indices 5-8 (1-based) are in layer4.

So for k=5, the position within layer4 is 5 - (2^{4-2}) =5-4=1. So the first character in layer4.

But how to compute the character. Each layer is the shifted version of the previous layers. So layer1 is "a". Layer2 is "b" (shifted once). Layer3 is "bc" (shifted once from layer1+layer2). Layer4 is "bccd" (shifted once from layer1+layer2+layer3). So each layer is the shifted version of the entire previous word.

But how to compute the character at position p in layer m. Since each layer is a shifted version of the previous word, each character in the layer is shifted by the number of operations that have been performed up to that layer.

Wait, each layer is generated by shifting the previous word once. So the first layer (layer1) is "a" (shifted 0 times). Layer2 is shifted once. Layer3 is shifted once from layer1+layer2. Wait, no. Let's think again.

The process is:

After 0 operations: word is layer1 ("a").

After 1 operation: word is layer1 + layer2, where layer2 is shifted once from layer1.

After 2 operations: word is layer1 + layer2 + layer3, where layer3 is shifted once from layer1+layer2.

After 3 operations: word is layer1 + layer2 + layer3 + layer4, where layer4 is shifted once from layer1+layer2+layer3.

So each layer m (for m >=2) is the shifted version of the previous word (sum of layers 1 to m-1). So each character in layer m is the previous character shifted by 1.

But how to model the shift count for each character in the layer. For example, layer4 is the shifted version of the previous word (sum of layers1-3: "abbc"). Shifting each character once gives "bccd".

So each character in layer m is the character from the previous word shifted by 1. So the shift count for each character in layer m is 1 more than the shift count for the previous word.

But the previous word is the sum of all layers up to m-1. So the shift count for each character in the previous word is the number of operations that have been performed to generate that character.

Wait, perhaps each character in the word has been shifted by a certain number of times. For example, the initial 'a' is shifted once in layer2, once in layer3, once in layer4, etc. So the total shift for the initial 'a' is the number of layers after it. For example, in layer4, the initial 'a' is part of the previous word (sum of layers1-3), which is shifted once to generate layer4. So the 'a' in layer1 is shifted once in layer2, once in layer3, once in layer4. So total shifts: 3 times. So 'a' becomes 'd' (a shifted 3 times: a→b→c→d).

But how to model this for each character in the layer. Let's think recursively. Each character in the previous word (sum of layers1 to m-1) is shifted once to generate the current layer m. So the shift count for each character in layer m is 1 more than the shift count for the previous word.

But the previous word's characters have their own shift counts. So this seems like a recursive problem.

Alternatively, each character in the entire word (after m operations) has been shifted by m times. Because each operation shifts all characters once. For example, after 3 operations, each character in the word has been shifted 3 times. So the initial 'a' becomes 'd' (a shifted 3 times). But in the example, the word after 3 operations is "abbcbccd". Let's see:

Original 'a' in layer1: shifted 3 times → 'd'.

But in the example, the word after 3 operations is "abbcbccd". Let's see:

Layer1: 'a' → shifted 3 times → 'd'.

Layer2: 'b' → shifted 3 times → 'e'.

Layer3: 'bc' → each character shifted 3 times: 'f' and 'g'.

Layer4: 'bccd' → each character shifted 3 times: 'e', 'f', 'e', 'f'.

But the example's word after 3 operations is "abbcbccd". Which is layers1-4: 'a' 'b' 'bc' 'bccd' → concatenated as 'abbc' + 'bccd' → 'abbcbccd'. So the characters in the final word are:

a (layer1, shifted 3 times → d)

b (layer2, shifted 3 times → e)

b (layer3, first character, shifted 3 times → e)

c (layer3, second character, shifted 3 times → f)

b (layer4, first character, shifted 3 times → e)

c (layer4, second character, shifted 3 times → f)

c (layer4, third character, shifted 3 times → f)

d (layer4, fourth character, shifted 3 times → e)

But the example's output for k=5 is 'b'. Wait, this suggests that the initial approach is incorrect. Because according to this, the 5th character (layer4's first character) would be 'e', but the example says it's 'b'.

So there's a mistake in this reasoning. So perhaps the shift count is not the number of operations. Let's re-examine the example.

In example1:

After 3 operations, the word is "abbcbccd". The 5th character is 'b'.

Let's break down the layers:

Layer1: 'a' → after 0 operations.

Layer2: 'b' → after 1 operation. So 'a' is shifted once to become 'b'.

Layer3: 'bc' → after 2 operations. The previous word is 'ab' (layers1+2). Each character is shifted once: 'a'→'b', 'b'→'c' → 'bc'.

Layer4: 'bccd' → after 3 operations. Previous word is 'abbc' (layers1+2+3). Each character is shifted once: 'a'→'b', 'b'→'c', 'b'→'c', 'c'→'d' → 'bccd'.

So the final word is 'a' + 'b' + 'bc' + 'bccd' → 'abbc' + 'bccd' → 'abbcbccd'.

The 5th character (1-based) is the first character of layer4, which is 'b'.

But according to the previous reasoning, the shift count for layer4 is 3 (since it's after 3 operations). So each character in layer4 is shifted 3 times. But 'b' shifted 3 times is 'e'. But in the example, it's 'b'. So this suggests that the shift count is not the number of operations. So the previous approach is wrong.

So what's the correct way to model the shift count for each character in each layer.

Let's think again. Each layer is generated by shifting the previous word once. So the shift count for each character in the current layer is the shift count of the previous word plus 1.

For example:

Layer1: shift count is 0. 'a' → 'a' (no shifts).

Layer2: generated by shifting layer1 once. So shift count is 1. 'a' → 'b'.

Layer3: generated by shifting the previous word (layer1+layer2) once. So each character in layer3 is shifted once from the previous word. The previous word's characters have shift counts of 0 (layer1) and 1 (layer2). So layer3's characters are shifted once more. So layer1's 'a' in layer3 is shifted once (total 1), layer2's 'b' is shifted once (total 2).

Layer4: generated by shifting the previous word (layer1+layer2+layer3) once. So each character in layer4 is shifted once from the previous word. The previous word's characters have shift counts of 0 (layer1), 1 (layer2), 1 (layer3's first character), 2 (layer3's second character). So layer4's characters are shifted once more. So layer1's 'a' in layer4 is shifted 0+1 (from layer2) +1 (layer3) +1 (layer4) → total 3 shifts. So 'a' becomes 'd'.

But in the example, the first character of layer4 is 'b', which is 'a' shifted once. So this suggests that the shift count is not cumulative. So perhaps each layer's shift count is the number of layers after it. For example, layer m has a shift count of m-1.

Wait, layer1: shift count 0.

layer2: shift count 1.

layer3: shift count 2.

layer4: shift count3.

But in layer3, the characters are generated by shifting the previous word (layers1+2) once. So each character in layer3 is shifted once from the previous word. The previous word's characters have shift counts of 0 (layer1) and 1 (layer2). So layer3's characters are shifted once more. So layer1's 'a' in layer3 is shifted once (total 1), layer2's 'b' is shifted once (total 2). So the shift count for layer3 is 2.

Similarly, layer4's characters are shifted once from the previous word (layers1+2+3). The previous word's characters have shift counts of 0,1,1,2. So layer4's characters are shifted once more. So the shift count for layer4 is 3.

But in the example, the first character of layer4 is 'b', which is 'a' shifted once. So according to this, 'a' shifted 3 times would be 'd', but the example shows 'b'. So this is a contradiction.

So there's a mistake in the reasoning. Let's re-examine the example.

In the example, after 3 operations, the word is "abbcbccd". The layers are:

layer1: 'a' → shift count 0.

layer2: 'b' → shift count 1.

layer3: 'bc' → shift count 2.

layer4: 'bccd' → shift count3.

So the first character of layer4 is 'b', which is 'a' shifted once. But according to the shift count of 3, 'a' shifted 3 times is 'd'. So this is a contradiction.

So the previous approach is incorrect. So what's the correct way to model the shift count for each character in each layer.

Alternative approach: Each time a layer is added, the characters in that layer are shifted once from the previous word. So the shift count for each character in layer m is the number of layers added after layer m. For example, layer4 is added after layers1-3. So the shift count for layer4 is 3 (since there are 3 layers after it: layers1,2,3). No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, each layer m is added after (m-1) operations. So the shift count for layer m is (m-1) times. Because each operation shifts the previous word once. So layer1 is added after 0 operations (shift count 0). layer2 after 1 operation (shift count1). layer3 after 2 operations (shift count2). layer4 after3 operations (shift count3). So each character in layer m is shifted (m-1) times.

But in the example, layer4's first character is 'b', which is 'a' shifted once. So according to this, 'a' shifted 3 times would be 'd', but the example shows 'b'. So this is not correct.

So there's a fundamental misunderstanding in the process. Let's re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says: each operation, Bob generates a new string by changing each character in the current word to its next character, and appends it to the original word.

So the new string is generated by shifting each character in the current word once. Then, the new word is the original word plus the new string.

So for example, initial word is "a". After first operation: new string is "b" (shifted once), append to original → "ab".

After second operation: new string is "bc" (shifted once from "ab"), append to original → "abbc".

After third operation: new string is "bccd" (shifted once from "abbc"), append to original → "abbcbccd".

So each operation adds a new string which is the shifted version of the current word. So the new string is the shifted version of the current word, and the new word is current word + new string.

So each character in the new string is shifted once from the current word. So the new string's characters are the current word's characters shifted once.

So the new word is current_word + shifted_current_word.

So the layers are:

layer1: "a" (current_word after 0 operations).

layer2: "b" (shifted once from layer1) → new word is "ab".

layer3: "bc" (shifted once from "ab") → new word is "abbc".

layer4: "bccd" (shifted once from "abbc") → new word is "abbcbccd".

So each layer m (after m-1 operations) is the shifted version of the previous word. So the shift count for each character in layer m is (m-1) times. Because each operation shifts the current word once. So layer1 is shifted 0 times. layer2 is shifted once. layer3 is shifted twice. layer4 is shifted three times. etc.

But in the example, layer4's first character is 'b', which is 'a' shifted once. But according to this, 'a' shifted three times would be 'd'. So this is a contradiction.

Wait, no. Let's see:

layer1: 'a' → shifted 0 times.

layer2: 'b' → shifted once.

layer3: 'bc' → each character is shifted once from "ab" → 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c'.

layer4: 'bccd' → each character is shifted once from "abbc" → 'a'→'b', 'b'→'c', 'b'→'c', 'c'→'d'.

So the first character of layer4 is 'b', which is 'a' shifted once. But according to the shift count of 3, 'a' would have been shifted three times. So this suggests that the shift count is not the number of operations, but the number of times the character has been shifted in the layers after it.

Wait, perhaps each character in the word is shifted once for each layer added after it. For example, the 'a' in layer1 is part of the current word for layers2,3,4. So each time a new layer is added, the 'a' is shifted once. So 'a' is shifted 3 times in total (once in layer2, once in layer3, once in layer4). So 'a' becomes 'd'.

But in the example, the 'a' in layer1 is part of the word after 3 operations. But in the final word, the 'a' is still 'a'? No, the final word after 3 operations is "abbcbccd". The first character is 'a', which is from layer1. But according to this, it should have been shifted 3 times. So this is a contradiction.

So there's a mistake in this reasoning. The problem is that the layers are added to the original word, not to the current word. So each operation appends the shifted current word to the original word. So the original word remains unchanged. Only the new string is appended.

Wait, no. The problem says: generate a new string by changing each character in the word to its next character, and append it to the original word. So the new word is the original word plus the new string.

So the original word is not modified. Only the new string is generated and appended. So the original word remains as it was. So for example, initial word is "a". After first operation, new string is "b", append to original → "ab". The original word is "a", but the new word is "ab". So the original word is not modified. Only the new string is appended.

So each character in the new string is shifted once from the original word. So the new string is the original word shifted once. So the new word is original + shifted_original.

So for example:

Original word: "a".

After first operation: new string is "b" (shifted once), new word is "a" + "b" = "ab".

After second operation: new string is "ab" shifted once → "bc", new word is "ab" + "bc" = "abbc".

After third operation: new string is "abbc" shifted once → "bccd", new word is "abbc" + "bccd" = "abbcbccd".

So each new string is the shifted version of the original word (the word before the operation). So the original word is not modified. So each new string is the shifted version of the original word. So the layers are:

layer1: "a" (original word after 0 operations).

layer2: "b" (shifted once from layer1) → new word is "ab".

layer3: "bc" (shifted once from layer1) → new word is "ab" + "bc" = "abbc".

Wait, no. Because after the first operation, the new word is "ab". The next operation's new string is the shifted version of "ab", which is "bc". So layer3 is "bc".

So the layers are:

layer1: "a" (original word after 0 operations).

layer2: "b" (shifted once from layer1) → new word is "ab".

layer3: "bc" (shifted once from "ab") → new word is "ab" + "bc" = "abbc".

layer4: "bccd" (shifted once from "abbc") → new word is "abbc" + "bccd" = "abbcbccd".

So each new layer is the shifted version of the previous new word. So the shift count for each layer is the number of operations performed. For example, layer2 is shifted once (operation1), layer3 is shifted once (operation2), layer4 is shifted once (operation3). So each layer's shift count is equal to the number of operations performed to generate it.

But each character in the new layer is shifted once from the previous new word. So the shift count for each character in layer m is m-1. For example, layer2 is shifted once (m=2, shift count 1). layer3 is shifted once (m=3, shift count 2). layer4 is shifted once (m=4, shift count3).

But how does this affect the characters in the layers. For example, the first character in layer2 is 'b' (shifted once from 'a'). The first character in layer3 is 'b' (shifted once from 'a' in layer1). The first character in layer4 is 'b' (shifted once from 'a' in layer1). So the shift count for the 'a' in layer1 is 3 (operations 1,2,3), but the 'a' in layer1 is not shifted in any of the operations. Because each operation appends the shifted version of the current word (which is the new word from the previous operation). So the original 'a' is not part of the current word after the first operation. So the 'a' in layer1 is only present in the first operation's new word. After that, the new word is "ab", which includes the 'a' and 'b' from the first operation. But in the next operation, the new string is shifted from "ab", so the 'a' and 'b' are shifted once to become 'b' and 'c', and appended to the original "ab" to form "abbc".

So the 'a' in layer1 is only present in the first operation's new word. After that, it's part of the new word and is shifted in subsequent operations. So the 'a' in layer1 is shifted once in operation1 (becomes 'b' in layer2), then in operation2, the 'b' is shifted to 'c' in layer3, and in operation3, the 'c' is shifted to 'd' in layer4. So the 'a' in layer1 is shifted three times, but each time in a different layer.

But the 'a' in layer1 is only present in the first operation's new word. So the 'a' in layer1 is part of the new word after operation1, but in operation2, the new word is "ab" + "bc" = "abbc". So the 'a' is part of the first two characters of the new word. So in operation2, the new string is shifted from "ab", so the 'a' and 'b' are shifted to 'b' and 'c', and appended to "ab" to form "abbc". So the 'a' in the first position is part of the new word after operation1, but in operation2, it's part of the current word and is shifted once. So the 'a' becomes 'b' in layer3.

So the 'a' in layer1 is shifted once in operation1 (layer2), once in operation2 (layer3), and once in operation3 (layer4). So total shifts of 3 times. So 'a' becomes 'd'.

But in the example, the first character of layer4 is 'b', which is 'a' shifted once. So this suggests that the 'a' in layer1 is not being shifted in layer4. So this is a contradiction.

This indicates that the initial approach is incorrect. So perhaps the shift count for each character in a layer is the number of operations performed up to that layer. For example, layer2 is after 1 operation, so shift count 1. layer3 is after 2 operations, shift count 2. layer4 is after 3 operations, shift count3. So each character in layer m is shifted m-1 times.

But in the example, the first character of layer4 is 'b', which is 'a' shifted once. So this would require that the shift count is 1, but m-1 is 3. So this is a contradiction.

So there's a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem. Let's re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says: each operation, Bob generates a new string by changing each character in the current word to its next character, and appends it to the original word.

So the new string is generated by shifting each character in the current word once. Then, the new word is the original word plus the new string.

So the original word is not modified. Only the new string is generated and appended. So the new string is the shifted version of the current word. The new word is current_word + new_string.

So for example:

Initial word: "a" (current_word).

Operation1: new_string is "b" (shifted once). new_word is "a" + "b" = "ab".

Operation2: new_string is "bc" (shifted once from "ab"). new_word is "ab" + "bc" = "abbc".

Operation3: new_string is "bccd" (shifted once from "abbc"). new_word is "abbc" + "bccd" = "abbcbccd".

So each new string is the shifted version of the current word. The current word is the new_word from the previous operation.

So the layers are:

layer1: "a" (current_word after 0 operations).

layer2: "b" (new_string of operation1).

layer3: "bc" (new_string of operation2).

layer4: "bccd" (new_string of operation3).

So each new string is a layer. The new_word is the concatenation of all layers up to that point.

So the k-th character is in one of the layers. For example, k=5 is in layer4.

Each layer m (after m-1 operations) is the new_string generated in the m-th operation. So layer m is the shifted version of the current_word before the m-th operation.

The current_word before the m-th operation is the concatenation of layers 1 to m-1.

So the shift count for layer m is the number of operations performed before it. For example, layer2 is shifted once (operation1). layer3 is shifted once (operation2). layer4 is shifted once (operation3). So each layer's shift count is equal to the number of operations performed before it. So layer m is shifted (m-1) times.

But how to compute the character in layer m at position p.

For example, layer4 is the new_string of operation3. It is the shifted version of the current_word before operation3, which is layers1-3: "abbc". So each character in layer4 is shifted once from "abbc".

So the first character of layer4 is 'a' shifted once → 'b'.

The second character is 'b' shifted once → 'c'.

Third character 'b' → 'c'.

Fourth character 'c' → 'd'.

So layer4 is "bccd".

So the first character of layer4 is 'b', which is correct according to the example.

So the shift count for layer4 is 3 (since it's after 3 operations). But the shift count for each character in layer4 is 3 (each character in the current_word before operation3 is shifted once, which is the third operation). So each character in layer4 is shifted once from the current_word before operation3.

But the current_word before operation3 is layers1-3: "abbc". Each character in this current_word has been shifted (m-1) times, where m is the operation number. For example, the 'a' in layer1 is shifted once in operation1 (layer2), once in operation2 (layer3), and once in operation3 (layer4). So total shifts of 3 times. So 'a' becomes 'd'.

But in layer4, the 'a' is part of the current_word before operation3. So when operation3 is performed, the current_word is "abbc", and the new_string is "bccd". So the 'a' in "abbc" is shifted once to become 'b' in layer4.

So the 'a' in layer1 is part of the current_word in operation1, operation2, and operation3. So it is shifted three times. But in layer4, the 'a' is part of the current_word before operation3, and is shifted once to become 'b' in layer4.

So the shift count for each character in layer m is (m-1) times. Because each operation before m shifts the character once.

So to compute the character in layer m at position p, we need to:

1. Find the character in the current_word before operation m (which is the concatenation of layers1 to m-1) at position p.

2. Shift it once (since layer m is the shifted version of the current_word before operation m).

But the current_word before operation m is the concatenation of layers1 to m-1. Each of those layers has their own shift counts. So the character in the current_word before operation m at position p is the original character from layer s, shifted (m-1 - s) times.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think recursively.

Each character in the current_word before operation m is the result of shifting the original character from some layer s by (m-1 - s) times.

For example, in operation3 (m=3), the current_word is layers1-2: "ab". Each character in "ab" is:

- 'a' from layer1, shifted 2-1=1 times (since m-1=2, s=1 → 2-1=1).

- 'b' from layer2, shifted 2-2=0 times (s=2 → 2-2=0).

So 'a' shifted once becomes 'b', 'b' shifted 0 times remains 'b'. So current_word is "bb".

But according to the example, the current_word before operation3 is "abbc". So this approach is incorrect.

Hmm, this suggests that the shift count for each character in the current_word before operation m is (m-1) times. Because each operation before m shifts the character once.

So for example, in operation3 (m=3), the current_word is layers1-2: "ab". Each character in "ab" has been shifted 2 times (since m-1=2). So 'a' shifted 2 times is 'c', 'b' shifted 2 times is 'd'. So current_word is "cd". But according to the example, the current_word before operation3 is "abbc", which is layers1-2: "ab" + "bc" = "abbc". So this approach is also incorrect.

So there's a fundamental misunderstanding of how the layers are built. Let's try to model the layers and their shift counts.

Each layer m is generated by shifting the current_word before operation m once. The current_word before operation m is the concatenation of layers1 to m-1.

So the shift count for each character in layer m is 1 more than the shift count of the corresponding character in the current_word before operation m.

But the current_word before operation m is the concatenation of layers1 to m-1. Each of those layers has their own shift counts.

So the shift count for a character in layer m is:

shift_count(m) = shift_count(current_word before m) + 1.

But the current_word before m is the concatenation of layers1 to m-1. Each of those layers' characters have their own shift counts.

This seems like a recursive problem. For example, the shift count for a character in layer m is the sum of the shift counts of all layers up to m-1 plus 1.

But this is not correct. For example, layer2's shift count is 1. layer3's shift count is 2. layer4's shift count is3. So each layer's shift count is m-1.

So the shift count for a character in layer m is m-1.

So to find the character in layer m at position p, we need to:

1. Find the character in the current_word before operation m at position p. This character is from some layer s, and has been shifted (m-1 - s) times.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps there's a pattern in the characters based on their position and the number of shifts.

Another approach: each character in the final word can be determined by the number of times it has been shifted. For example, the initial 'a' is shifted once in each operation. So after m operations, it has been shifted m times. But this is not correct, because the initial 'a' is part of the current_word in the first operation, but after that, it's part of the new_word and may be shifted in subsequent operations.

Alternatively, each character in the new_word is shifted once for each operation after it was added. For example, a character added in operation s is shifted in operations s+1, s+2, ..., m. So the total number of shifts is m - s.

So for example, the 'a' in layer1 is added in operation0. It is shifted in operations1,2,3. So total shifts 3. So 'a' becomes 'd'.

The 'b' in layer2 is added in operation1. It is shifted in operations2,3. So total shifts 2. So 'b' becomes 'c'.

The 'b' in layer3 (position2) is added in operation2. It is shifted in operation3. So total shifts1. So 'b' becomes 'c'.

The 'c' in layer3 (position3) is added in operation2. It is shifted in operation3. So total shifts1. So 'c' becomes 'd'.

The 'b' in layer4 (position5) is added in operation3. It is shifted in no operations after that. So total shifts0. So 'b' remains 'b'.

The 'c' in layer4 (position6) is added in operation3. Shifts0. So 'c' remains 'c'.

The 'c' in layer4 (position7) is added in operation3. Shifts0. So 'c' remains 'c'.

The 'd' in layer4 (position8) is added in operation3. Shifts0. So 'd' remains 'd'.

So the final word is:

a (shifted3 →d) → but in the example, it's 'a' in the first position. So this is a contradiction.

But according to the example, the first character is 'a', which is not shifted. So this approach is also incorrect.

This suggests that the initial assumption is wrong. The problem is that the new string is appended to the original word, not to the current word. So the original word remains unchanged. So each new string is generated from the original word, not the current word.

Wait, no. The problem says: generate a new string by changing each character in the word to its next character, and append it to the original word.

So the 'word' here refers to the current word. So each operation, the new string is generated from the current word, and appended to the current word. So the new word is current_word + new_string.

So the current_word is updated to new_word = current_word + new_string.

So for example:

Initial word: "a".

Operation1: new_string is "b" (shifted once from "a"). new_word is "a" + "b" = "ab".

Operation2: new_string is "bc" (shifted once from "ab"). new_word is "ab" + "bc" = "abbc".

Operation3: new_string is "bccd" (shifted once from "abbc"). new_word is "abbc" + "bccd" = "abbcbccd".

So each new string is the shifted version of the current_word before the operation. The current_word is updated to new_word = current_word + new_string.

So each character in the new string is shifted once from the current_word before the operation. The current_word before the operation is the new_word from the previous operation.

So the layers are:

layer1: "a" (current_word after 0 operations).

layer2: "b" (new_string of operation1).

layer3: "bc" (new_string of operation2).

layer4: "bccd" (new_string of operation3).

The new_word after each operation is the concatenation of all layers up to that point.

So each character in layer m is shifted once from the current_word before operation m. The current_word before operation m is the concatenation of layers1 to m-1.

So the shift count for each character in layer m is the number of operations performed before m. For example, layer2 is shifted once (operation1). layer3 is shifted once (operation2). layer4 is shifted once (operation3). So each layer's shift count is m-1.

But how to compute the character in layer m at position p.

For example, in layer4 (m=4), the shift count is3. So each character in layer4 is shifted once from the current_word before operation4 (which is layers1-3: "abbc"). So each character in "abbc" is shifted once to become "bccd".

So the first character of layer4 is 'a' shifted once → 'b'.

The second character is 'b' shifted once → 'c'.

Third character 'b' → 'c'.

Fourth character 'c' → 'd'.

So layer4 is "bccd".

So the first character of layer4 is 'b', which matches the example.

So the shift count for each character in layer m is m-1. So to compute the character in layer m at position p, we need to:

1. Find the character in the current_word before operation m at position p. This character is from some layer s, and has been shifted (m-1 - s) times.

But this seems complicated. Another approach is to realize that each character in the final word is determined by the number of times it has been shifted. For example, the initial 'a' is shifted once in each operation. So after m operations, it has been shifted m times. But this is not correct, because the initial 'a' is part of the current_word in the first operation, but after that, it's part of the new_word and may be shifted in subsequent operations.

Alternatively, each character in the new string of operation m is shifted once from the current_word before operation m. The current_word before operation m is the concatenation of layers1 to m-1. So each character in layer m is shifted once from the current_word before operation m.

But the current_word before operation m is the concatenation of layers1 to m-1. Each of those layers' characters have been shifted (m-1 - s) times, where s is the operation in which they were added.

So the character in layer m at position p is the character from the current_word before operation m at position p, shifted once.

But the current_word before operation m is the concatenation of layers1 to m-1. So the character at position p in the current_word before operation m is the same as the character at position p in the concatenation of layers1 to m-1.

But each of those layers' characters have been shifted (m-1 - s) times, where s is the operation in which they were added.

So the character in layer m at position p is:

original_char = character from layer s at position p, where s is the layer that contains position p in the current_word before operation m.

shifted once.

But this is getting too complicated. Perhaps there's a pattern based on the binary representation of k.

Another observation: the k-th character is in the m-th layer, where m is the smallest integer such that 2^m >=k. For example, k=5: 2^3=8 >=5 → m=3. But the layers are 1-based. So layer3 is the third layer. But according to the example, k=5 is in layer4. So this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, the layers are 0-based. For example, layer0 is the first layer. So for k=5, m=3 (since 2^3=8 >=5). So layer3 is the fourth layer. Which matches the example.

So the part number is m, where m is the smallest integer such that 2^m >=k. So m = ceil(log2(k)).

Once we find m, the position within the layer is p = k - 2^(m-1).

For example, k=5: m=3 (2^3=8 >=5). p=5-4=1. So the first character in layer3.

But layer3 is the fourth layer (if layers are 0-based). So the character is the first character of layer3.

But layer3 is "bc" (shifted once from "ab"). So the first character is 'b', which matches the example.

So the approach is:

1. Find m such that 2^m is the smallest power of two >=k. m is the bit length of (k-1). For example, k=5: k-1=4 (100), bit length is3 → m=3.

2. The position within the layer is p =k - 2^(m-1).

3. The character in the layer m at position p is 'a' shifted (m) times. Because each layer m is shifted m times.

Wait, but in the example, layer3 (m=3) is shifted 3 times. The first character is 'b', which is 'a' shifted once. So this is not correct.

Alternatively, the character in layer m at position p is 'a' shifted (m) times plus p.

But this is not clear.

Another approach: each layer m is a sequence of characters that are shifted m times from the original 'a'. For example:

layer1: 'a' shifted 0 times → 'a'.

layer2: 'a' shifted 1 time → 'b'.

layer3: 'a' shifted 2 times → 'c'.

layer4: 'a' shifted 3 times → 'd'.

But this is not correct, as layer3 is "bc", which is 'b' and 'c' (shifted once and twice).

So this approach is also incorrect.

Alternative idea: each character in layer m is 'a' shifted m times, but the position in the layer determines the original character. For example, layer m has 2^{m-2} characters. The first character is 'a' shifted m times, the second is 'b' shifted m times, etc. But this is not correct.

Alternatively, each character in layer m is 'a' shifted m times, but the position in the layer is determined by the binary representation of p. For example, p=1 in layer3 (m=3) is 'b' (1 in binary is 1, which is 'b' shifted 3 times? No, 'a' shifted 3 times is 'd').

This is not working.

Another observation: each layer m is a string of length 2^{m-2} for m >=2. The first character of layer m is 'a' shifted m-1 times. The second character is 'b' shifted m-1 times. And so on.

For example:

layer2 (m=2): length 1. First character is 'a' shifted 1 time → 'b'.

layer3 (m=3): length 2. First character 'a' shifted 2 times → 'c', second 'b' shifted 2 times → 'd'.

layer4 (m=4): length4. First character 'a' shifted3 times → 'd', second 'b' shifted3 → 'e', third 'c' shifted3 → 'f', fourth 'd' shifted3 → 'g'.

But according to the example, layer4's first character is 'b', which is 'a' shifted once. So this is not correct.

So this approach is also incorrect.

At this point, it's clear that the initial approach of simulating the process is not feasible for large k. So we need a mathematical approach to determine the character based on the position in the layer and the number of shifts.

Let's think about the position in the layer. For a given k, we find the layer m and the position p within the layer. The character in the layer m at position p is the character from the previous word (current_word before operation m) at position p, shifted once.

The previous word is the concatenation of layers1 to m-1. So the character at position p in the previous word is the same as the character at position p in the concatenation of layers1 to m-1.

But each of those layers' characters have been shifted (m-1 - s) times, where s is the operation in which they were added.

So the character in the previous word at position p is the original character from some layer s, shifted (m-1 - s) times.

But this is getting too complicated. Perhaps there's a pattern based on the binary representation of p.

Another observation: each layer m is a binary tree-like structure. For example, layer2 is 'b', layer3 is 'bc', layer4 is 'bccd', etc. The characters in each layer are built by appending the shifted version of the previous word. So each character in layer m is the previous character shifted once.

But this is not helpful.

Alternative approach: each character in the final word can be determined by the number of times it has been shifted. For example, the initial 'a' is shifted once in each operation. So after m operations, it has been shifted m times. But this is not correct, as the initial 'a' is part of the current_word in the first operation, but after that, it's part of the new_word and may be shifted in subsequent operations.

But perhaps each character in the new_word is shifted once for each operation after it was added. For example, a character added in operation s is shifted in operations s+1, s+2, ..., m. So the total number of shifts is m - s.

So for example, the 'a' in layer1 is added in operation0. It is shifted in operations1,2,3. So total shifts3. So 'a' becomes 'd'.

The 'b' in layer2 is added in operation1. It is shifted in operations2,3. So total shifts2. So 'b' becomes 'c'.

The 'b' in layer3 (position2) is added in operation2. It is shifted in operation3. So total shifts1. So 'b' becomes 'c'.

The 'c' in layer3 (position3) is added in operation2. It is shifted in operation3. So total shifts1. So 'c' becomes 'd'.

The 'b' in layer4 (position5) is added in operation3. It is shifted in no operations after that. So total shifts0. So 'b' remains 'b'.

The 'c' in layer4 (position6) is added in operation3. Shifts0. So 'c' remains 'c'.

The 'c' in layer4 (position7) is added in operation3. Shifts0. So 'c' remains 'c'.

The 'd' in layer4 (position8) is added in operation3. Shifts0. So 'd' remains 'd'.

So the final word is:

a (shifted3 →d) → but in the example, it's 'a' in the first position. So this is a contradiction.

But according to the example, the first character is 'a', which is not shifted. So this approach is incorrect.

This suggests that the initial assumption is wrong. The problem is that the new string is appended to the original word, not the current word. So the original word remains unchanged. So each new string is generated from the original word, not the current word.

But according to the problem statement, the new string is generated from the current word. So the current word is updated to new_word = current_word + new_string.

So the current_word is the new_word from the previous operation.

So the 'a' in layer1 is part of the current_word in operation1. In operation2, the new string is generated from "ab", so the 'a' is shifted once to 'b' in layer3. In operation3, the new string is generated from "abbc", so the 'a' is shifted once to 'b' in layer4.

So the 'a' in layer1 is shifted once in operation1 (layer2), once in operation2 (layer3), and once in operation3 (layer4). So total shifts3. So 'a' becomes 'd'.

But in the example, the first character of layer4 is 'b', which is 'a' shifted once. So this is a contradiction.

This indicates that the problem is not being modeled correctly. Perhaps the shift count is not the number of operations, but the number of times the character has been part of the current_word during operations.

But this is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows:

Each character in the final word is determined by the number of times it has been shifted. The k-th character is in the m-th layer, where m is the smallest integer such that 2^m >=k. The position within the layer is p =k - 2^(m-1). The character is 'a' shifted (m) times plus p.

But this is not correct. For example, in the example, m=3, p=1. 'a' shifted3 times is 'd', plus 1 → 'e', which is not correct.

Alternatively, the character is 'a' shifted (m) times, and the position p is used to determine the original character. For example, p=1 in layer3 (m=3) is 'b' (1 in binary is 1, which is 'b' shifted3 times? No, 'a' shifted3 times is 'd').

This is not working.

Another idea: each character in the layer m is 'a' shifted (m) times, but the position p is used to determine the number of times it has been shifted. For example, p=1 in layer3 (m=3) is 'b' shifted3 times → 'e'.

But this is not matching the example.

At this point, I think the correct approach is to model the problem using the binary representation of k. Each character in the final word can be determined by the binary digits of (k-
