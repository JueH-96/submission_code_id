Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have two arrays, nums1 and nums2, and I have to replace all the zeros with positive integers such that the sum of both arrays becomes equal. And I have to find the minimum possible sum, or return -1 if it's impossible. Hmm.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. So, the zeros in both arrays must be replaced with positive integers. That means each zero in the arrays can't be zero anymore. So, for example, if a zero is in nums1, it has to be replaced with at least 1. And the same for nums2.

The goal is to make the sum of both arrays equal. And among all possible ways to replace the zeros, find the minimum possible sum. If there's no way to do this, return -1.

Let me think about the approach. Let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the sum of the non-zero elements in both arrays. Then, count the number of zeros in each array. Because each zero contributes at least 1 to the sum. So the minimal sum added by the zeros in nums1 is the number of zeros in nums1 (since each is at least 1). Similarly for nums2.

Wait, but the sum of the arrays after replacement must be equal. So the total sum for nums1 after replacement is sum_non_zero1 + zeros1 * 1 (if all zeros are replaced by 1) plus any additional values. But since we want the minimal possible sum, perhaps the optimal way is to replace zeros with 1s first, then adjust to make the sums equal.

Wait, but how? Let's think. Let's say the sum of nums1 (after replacing zeros with 1s) is S1, and sum of nums2 (after replacing zeros with 1s) is S2. Then, the difference between S1 and S2 must be made up by adding some values to the zeros in one of the arrays. But since we can only add positive integers (so each zero can be increased by any amount), but we need the total sums to be equal.

Wait, but the problem allows replacing zeros with any positive integers, not just 1. So the minimal sum would be when the zeros are as small as possible. So the initial approach is to replace all zeros with 1, then see if the sums can be adjusted to be equal. But how?

Wait, maybe the minimal possible sum is when the sum of the two arrays after replacement is the maximum of the two minimal possible sums (sum1 and sum2 after replacing zeros with 1). Because if sum1 is less than sum2, then we need to increase sum1 to sum2's level, but that's not possible unless sum2 can be adjusted. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Let me take an example. Suppose after replacing zeros with 1, sum1 is 10 and sum2 is 15. Then, to make them equal, we need to increase sum1 by 5, but sum2 can't be decreased. So that's impossible. So in that case, the answer is -1. Wait, but maybe sum2 can be increased as well. Wait, no. Because the sum of the arrays must be equal. So if sum1 is 10 and sum2 is 15, then to make them equal, sum1 must be increased to 15 (so sum2 can stay at 15) or sum2 must be increased to 10 (but sum2 is already 15, which is higher than 10). So that's impossible. So the answer would be -1.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's see. The sum of the two arrays after replacement must be equal. So, sum1 + sum2 must be even? No, no. Wait, no. The sum of each array must be equal. So sum1 must equal sum2. So, the total sum for each array is the same. So, the sum of nums1 after replacement is S, and sum of nums2 after replacement is S. So, the total sum for each array is S.

So, the problem is to find the minimal S such that:

sum1_initial + sum_zeros1 * x1 = S, where x1 is the sum of the values added to the zeros in nums1 (each x1_i >=1, and the number of zeros in nums1 is zeros1). Wait, no. Wait, each zero in nums1 is replaced by a value >=1. So the sum of the zeros in nums1 is the sum of the values assigned to them, which must be at least zeros1 (since each is at least 1). Similarly for nums2.

So, the sum of nums1 after replacement is sum_non_zero1 + sum_zeros1_replaced, where sum_zeros1_replaced >= zeros1. Similarly for nums2.

We need sum_non_zero1 + sum_zeros1_replaced = sum_non_zero2 + sum_zeros2_replaced.

And sum_zeros1_replaced >= zeros1, sum_zeros2_replaced >= zeros2.

We need to find the minimal possible S = sum_non_zero1 + sum_zeros1_replaced = sum_non_zero2 + sum_zeros2_replaced.

So, how can we model this?

Let me denote:

sum1 = sum of non-zero elements in nums1.

sum2 = sum of non-zero elements in nums2.

zeros1 = number of zeros in nums1.

zeros2 = number of zeros in nums2.

Then, the equations are:

sum1 + a = sum2 + b, where a >= zeros1, b >= zeros2.

We need to find the minimal possible sum1 + a (which equals sum2 + b) such that a and b satisfy the above equation and constraints.

So, sum1 + a = sum2 + b.

We can rearrange this as a - b = sum2 - sum1.

But a >= zeros1, b >= zeros2.

So, substituting a = sum2 - sum1 + b.

But a must be >= zeros1, so sum2 - sum1 + b >= zeros1.

But b >= zeros2.

So, sum2 - sum1 + zeros2 >= zeros1 - sum2 + sum1 ?

Wait, maybe this approach is getting complicated. Let's think of possible scenarios.

Case 1: sum1 + zeros1 <= sum2 + zeros2.

In this case, the minimal possible sum is sum2 + zeros2. Because sum1's minimal possible sum (sum1 + zeros1) is less than sum2's minimal sum (sum2 + zeros2). So to make them equal, sum1's sum must be increased to sum2 + zeros2. But sum1 can be increased by adding more to the zeros. So, sum1 + a = sum2 + zeros2. So a = sum2 + zeros2 - sum1. But a must be >= zeros1. So sum2 + zeros2 - sum1 >= zeros1. Which is equivalent to sum2 + zeros2 - sum1 >= zeros1. Which is sum2 + zeros2 >= sum1 + zeros1. Which is the case we are in. So this is possible. Then the minimal sum is sum2 + zeros2.

Wait, but wait. Let's see. For example, in example 1:

nums1 = [3,2,0,1,0], sum1 is 3+2+1=6. zeros1 is 2.

nums2 = [6,5,0], sum2 is 6+5=11. zeros2 is 1.

sum1 + zeros1 = 6+2=8. sum2 + zeros2=11+1=12. So sum1's minimal sum is 8, sum2's is 12. So the minimal possible sum is 12. Which is the example's answer. So in this case, the answer is sum2 + zeros2.

But wait, in the example, sum1's sum after replacement is 6 + 2 +4 (the two zeros replaced by 2 and 4) = 12. sum2's sum is 11 +1=12. So the sum is 12, which is sum2's minimal sum. So that's correct.

So in this case, the answer is sum2 + zeros2.

But what if sum1's minimal sum is higher than sum2's minimal sum?

Case 2: sum1 + zeros1 > sum2 + zeros2.

Then, the minimal possible sum is sum1 + zeros1. Because sum2's sum can be increased to sum1 + zeros1. So sum2 + b = sum1 + zeros1. So b = sum1 + zeros1 - sum2. But b must be >= zeros2. So sum1 + zeros1 - sum2 >= zeros2. Which is sum1 + zeros1 >= sum2 + zeros2. Which is the case we are in. So this is possible. Then the minimal sum is sum1 + zeros1.

But wait, let's take an example. Suppose sum1 is 10, zeros1 is 3. sum1 + zeros1 is 13. sum2 is 5, zeros2 is 2. sum2 + zeros2 is 7. So sum1's minimal sum is 13, sum2's is 7. So the minimal possible sum is 13. So sum2's sum must be increased to 13. So b = 13 -5 =8. But zeros2 is 2, so 8 >=2. So possible. So the answer is 13.

So in this case, the answer is sum1 + zeros1.

But what if sum1 + zeros1 and sum2 + zeros2 are equal? Then the answer is sum1 + zeros1 (or sum2 + zeros2, same thing).

So the minimal possible sum is the maximum between (sum1 + zeros1) and (sum2 + zeros2). But wait, no. Because if sum1 + zeros1 is greater than sum2 + zeros2, then the minimal sum is sum1 + zeros1. But sum2 can be increased to that sum. So the answer is the maximum of the two minimal sums.

Wait, but in the first case, when sum1's minimal sum is less than sum2's, then the answer is sum2's minimal sum. So the answer is the maximum of the two minimal sums. Because the minimal sum for each array is sum + zeros. So the maximum of these two is the minimal possible sum that can be achieved by making the two arrays' sums equal.

But wait, let's see. Let's take sum1 + zeros1 = 8, sum2 + zeros2 = 12. The maximum is 12. So the answer is 12. Which is correct.

Another example: sum1 + zeros1 = 13, sum2 + zeros2 =7. The maximum is 13. So answer is 13.

If sum1 + zeros1 is 10, sum2 + zeros2 is 10. Then the answer is 10.

So the minimal possible sum is the maximum of (sum1 + zeros1, sum2 + zeros2). But wait, is that always possible?

Wait, but what if the difference between sum1 and sum2 is such that even after adding the minimal zeros, the sum can't be made equal?

For example, let's say sum1 is 5, zeros1 is 0. sum2 is 3, zeros2 is 0. Then sum1 + zeros1 is 5, sum2 + zeros2 is 3. The maximum is 5. But sum2 can't be increased because there are no zeros. So sum2's sum is fixed at 3. So sum1's sum is 5, which can't be equal to 3. So the answer is -1.

Ah, right. So the initial approach of taking the maximum of the two minimal sums is not sufficient. Because in some cases, even after adding the minimal zeros, the sum can't be made equal.

So the correct approach is:

Compute the minimal possible sum for each array (sum1 + zeros1 and sum2 + zeros2). Let's call these s1 and s2.

If s1 > s2: then to make the sums equal, sum2's sum must be increased to s1. But sum2's sum can be increased by adding to the zeros. The required increase is s1 - s2. But sum2's zeros can contribute at least (zeros2) (if all are 1). So the required increase is (s1 - s2) must be >=0. But since s1 > s2, s1 - s2 is positive. So sum2's sum can be increased by (s1 - s2) by adding to the zeros. But how?

Wait, sum2's sum after replacement is s2 + b, where b is the sum of the values added to the zeros (each >=1). So the minimal sum for sum2 is s2, and any higher sum is possible. So to reach s1, sum2's sum must be s1. So s2 + b = s1. So b = s1 - s2. But since each zero in sum2 can be increased by any amount, as long as the sum of the increases is (s1 - s2). But since each zero can be increased by at least 1, the minimal sum for sum2 is s2, and any higher sum is possible. So as long as s1 >= s2, and s1 - s2 >=0, then it's possible. But wait, sum2's sum can be increased to s1 by adding (s1 - s2) to the sum. But how? Because sum2's sum is s2 (sum of non-zero elements plus zeros replaced by 1). To reach s1, the sum of the zeros in sum2 must be increased by (s1 - s2). But each zero can be increased by any amount. So as long as (s1 - s2) is >=0, then it's possible. Because you can distribute the (s1 - s2) among the zeros. For example, if sum2's zeros are 2, and (s1 - s2) is 5, then you can add 5 to one zero (making it 6) and 0 to the other (but wait, no, because each zero must be replaced by at least 1. So the sum of the zeros in sum2 is at least zeros2. So when you add (s1 - s2) to the sum of the zeros, the sum of the zeros becomes s2_zeros_initial (which is zeros2) plus (s1 - s2). So the sum of the zeros in sum2 is zeros2 + (s1 - s2). Which is allowed as long as each zero is at least 1. But since s1 - s2 is >=0, and zeros2 is the number of zeros, adding (s1 - s2) to the sum of the zeros (which was initially zeros2) would mean that each zero is at least 1. Because the sum is zeros2 + (s1 - s2) = s1 - s2 + zeros2. But how is that possible? For example, if sum2's zeros are 2, and s1 - s2 is 3. Then the sum of the zeros is 2 +3=5. So the two zeros can be 2 and 3, which are both >=1. So that's allowed.

So in this case, when s1 >= s2, then it's possible to make the sums equal. So the answer is s1.

But wait, in the example where sum1 is 5, zeros1 is 0, sum2 is 3, zeros2 is 0. Then s1 is 5, s2 is 3. s1 > s2. So according to the approach, the answer is s1=5. But sum2's sum is fixed at 3 (no zeros to replace), and sum1's sum is 5 (no zeros to replace). So they can't be equal. So the answer should be -1. But according to the approach, the answer would be 5, which is wrong.

Ah, so the approach is missing a check. So the correct approach is:

Compute s1 = sum1 + zeros1.

Compute s2 = sum2 + zeros2.

If s1 == s2: then the answer is s1.

Else, if s1 > s2: then check if (s1 - s2) can be covered by the sum of the zeros in sum2. Wait, no. Because sum2's sum can be increased to s1 by adding (s1 - s2) to the sum of the zeros. But sum2's sum of zeros is initially zeros2 (each replaced by 1). So the sum of the zeros can be increased by any amount. So as long as s1 >= s2, then it's possible. But in the example where sum1 is 5 (no zeros), sum2 is 3 (no zeros), s1=5, s2=3. Then s1 > s2. But sum2 can't be increased because there are no zeros. So the answer is -1.

So the approach must also check that the sum can be adjusted. So the steps are:

1. Compute sum1, zeros1, sum2, zeros2.

2. Compute s1 = sum1 + zeros1.

3. Compute s2 = sum2 + zeros2.

4. If s1 == s2: return s1.

5. Else, if s1 > s2:

   a. Check if sum2 can be increased to s1. To do that, sum2's sum after replacement is s2 + b, where b is the sum of the values added to the zeros in sum2. But sum2's sum after replacement must be s1. So s2 + b = s1. So b = s1 - s2. But since sum2's zeros can be increased by any amount (as long as each is >=1), the sum of the zeros can be increased by any amount. So as long as s1 >= s2, and sum2's sum can be increased to s1. But sum2's sum can be increased to s1 only if sum2's sum plus the sum of the zeros (after replacement) equals s1. Wait, no. sum2's sum after replacement is sum2_non_zero + sum_zeros_replaced. sum_zeros_replaced must be >= zeros2. So sum2_after = sum2_non_zero + sum_zeros_replaced. sum_zeros_replaced can be any value >= zeros2. So sum2_after can be any value >= sum2_non_zero + zeros2 = s2. So to reach s1, sum2_after must be s1. So s1 must be >= s2. Which is the case. So in this case, it's possible. But in the example where sum1 is 5 (no zeros), sum2 is 3 (no zeros), s1=5, s2=3. Then sum2_after is 3 (can't be increased). So sum1_after is 5. So they are not equal. So the answer is -1.

So the problem is that when s1 > s2, but sum2 has no zeros (zeros2=0), then sum2 can't be increased. So in that case, even if s1 > s2, but sum2 can't be increased, then it's impossible.

So the correct approach is:

If s1 == s2: return s1.

Else, if s1 > s2:

   Check if sum2 can be increased to s1. sum2 can be increased to s1 only if sum2's sum after replacement is s1. sum2's sum after replacement is sum2_non_zero + sum_zeros_replaced. sum_zeros_replaced must be >= zeros2. So sum2_after = sum2_non_zero + sum_zeros_replaced. We need sum2_after = s1. So sum_zeros_replaced = s1 - sum2_non_zero. But sum_zeros_replaced must be >= zeros2. So s1 - sum2_non_zero >= zeros2. sum2_non_zero is sum2 (since sum2 is sum of non-zero elements). So s1 - sum2 >= zeros2. So s1 >= sum2 + zeros2. But s1 is sum1 + zeros1. So sum1 + zeros1 >= sum2 + zeros2. Which is the case when s1 > s2. Because s1 > s2 implies sum1 + zeros1 > sum2 + zeros2. So sum1 + zeros1 >= sum2 + zeros2. So s1 >= sum2 + zeros2. So s1 - sum2 >= zeros2. So sum_zeros_replaced = s1 - sum2 >= zeros2. So it's possible. But wait, sum_zeros_replaced is s1 - sum2. But sum_zeros_replaced must be >= zeros2. So s1 - sum2 >= zeros2. Which is equivalent to sum1 + zeros1 - sum2 >= zeros2. sum1 + zeros1 >= sum2 + zeros2. Which is true because s1 > s2. So sum_zeros_replaced is s1 - sum2, which is >= zeros2. So it's possible. But in the example where sum1 is 5 (no zeros), sum2 is 3 (no zeros), s1=5, s2=3. Then sum_zeros_replaced would be 5-3=2. But sum2's zeros are 0. So sum_zeros_replaced must be 0. But 2 !=0. So it's impossible.

Ah, so the problem is that when sum2 has no zeros (zeros2=0), then sum_zeros_replaced must be 0. So in that case, sum2_after is sum2_non_zero + 0 = sum2. So sum2_after is 3. sum1_after is 5. So they are not equal. So the answer is -1.

So the approach must check that when s1 > s2, then sum2 can be increased to s1. But sum2 can be increased to s1 only if sum2's sum after replacement is s1, which requires that sum2's sum after replacement (sum2_non_zero + sum_zeros_replaced) equals s1. sum_zeros_replaced must be >= zeros2. So sum_zeros_replaced = s1 - sum2_non_zero. So sum_zeros_replaced must be >= zeros2. So s1 - sum2_non_zero >= zeros2. Which is sum1 + zeros1 - sum2 >= zeros2. sum1 + zeros1 >= sum2 + zeros2. Which is true because s1 > s2. But sum_zeros_replaced is s1 - sum2. But sum_zeros_replaced must be >= zeros2. So s1 - sum2 >= zeros2. Which is sum1 + zeros1 - sum2 >= zeros2. sum1 + zeros1 >= sum2 + zeros2. Which is true. So in this case, it's possible. But in the example where sum2 has no zeros, sum_zeros_replaced is s1 - sum2. But sum_zeros_replaced must be 0 (since zeros2=0). So s1 - sum2 must be 0. But s1 > s2, so s1 - sum2 is positive. So this is impossible. So the approach is missing this check.

So the correct approach is:

If s1 == s2: return s1.

Else, if s1 > s2:

   Check if sum2 can be increased to s1. For that, sum2's sum after replacement must be s1. sum2's sum after replacement is sum2_non_zero + sum_zeros_replaced. sum_zeros_replaced must be >= zeros2. So sum_zeros_replaced = s1 - sum2_non_zero. So sum_zeros_replaced must be >= zeros2. So s1 - sum2 >= zeros2. Which is sum1 + zeros1 - sum2 >= zeros2. sum1 + zeros1 >= sum2 + zeros2. Which is true because s1 > s2. But also, sum_zeros_replaced must be >= zeros2. So s1 - sum2 >= zeros2. Which is sum1 + zeros1 - sum2 >= zeros2. sum1 + zeros1 >= sum2 + zeros2. Which is true. But in the case where sum2 has no zeros (zeros2=0), then sum_zeros_replaced must be 0. So s1 - sum2 must be 0. But s1 > s2, so this is impossible. So in that case, it's impossible.

So the correct approach is:

If s1 == s2: return s1.

Else, if s1 > s2:

   Check if (s1 - sum2) >= zeros2. Because sum_zeros_replaced is s1 - sum2, which must be >= zeros2. But sum_zeros_replaced is the sum of the values added to the zeros in sum2. Each zero must be at least 1, so the sum of the zeros in sum2 after replacement is sum_zeros_replaced. So sum_zeros_replaced must be >= zeros2. So s1 - sum2 >= zeros2. Which is sum1 + zeros1 - sum2 >= zeros2. sum1 + zeros1 >= sum2 + zeros2. Which is true. But in the case where sum2 has no zeros (zeros2=0), then sum_zeros_replaced must be 0. So s1 - sum2 must be 0. But s1 > s2, so this is impossible. So in that case, even if s1 > s2, but sum2 has no zeros, then it's impossible.

So the correct condition is:

If s1 > s2:

   Then, sum2 can be increased to s1 only if (s1 - sum2) >= zeros2. But sum_zeros_replaced is s1 - sum2. So sum_zeros_replaced must be >= zeros2. So s1 - sum2 >= zeros2. Which is sum1 + zeros1 - sum2 >= zeros2. sum1 + zeros1 >= sum2 + zeros2. Which is true. But in the case where sum2 has no zeros (zeros2=0), then sum_zeros_replaced must be 0. So s1 - sum2 must be 0. But s1 > s2, so this is impossible. So the condition is not sufficient.

So perhaps the correct approach is:

If s1 > s2:

   Then, sum2 can be increased to s1 only if sum2's sum after replacement is s1, which requires that sum_zeros_replaced = s1 - sum2. And sum_zeros_replaced must be >= zeros2. So s1 - sum2 >= zeros2. But also, sum_zeros_replaced must be >= zeros2. So s1 - sum2 >= zeros2. Which is sum1 + zeros1 - sum2 >= zeros2. sum1 + zeros1 >= sum2 + zeros2. Which is true.

But also, sum_zeros_replaced must be >= zeros2. So s1 - sum2 >= zeros2. Which is sum1 + zeros1 - sum2 >= zeros2. sum1 + zeros1 >= sum2 + zeros2. Which is true. But in the case where sum2 has no zeros (zeros2=0), then sum_zeros_replaced must be 0. So s1 - sum2 must be 0. But s1 > s2, so this is impossible. So the condition is not sufficient.

So perhaps the correct approach is:
