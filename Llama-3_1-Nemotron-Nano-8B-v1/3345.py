Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the sum of the power of all subsequences of a given array. The power is the number of subsequences that sum to k. Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says that the power of an array is the number of subsequences with sum equal to k. But then, the overall answer is the sum of the power of all possible subsequences of nums. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement.

Oh right, the problem says: Return the sum of power of all subsequences of nums. So each possible subsequence of nums contributes its own power (the number of its subsequences that sum to k) to the total sum. And I need to compute this sum modulo 1e9+7.

Hmm. So for example, in the first example, the input is [1,2,3], k=3. The output is 6. The explanation lists several subsequences of the original array, each contributing their own count. For instance, the subsequence [1,2,3] (the entire array) has 2 subsequences that sum to 3 (like [1,2], [3], but wait the example explanation says [1,2,3] and [1,2,3]? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example. Let me check the example again.

Wait the first example's explanation says:

The subsequence [1,2,3] has 2 subsequences with sum 3: [1,2,3] and [1,2,3]. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe there's a typo. Let me look again. Oh, the example says:

Wait the first example's explanation says:

There are 5 subsequences of nums with non-zero power. Then each of those 5 contributes their power. For example, the first one (the entire array) contributes 2, then others contribute 1 each. So the total is 2+1+1+1+1=6.

Wait, but how does the entire array have 2 subsequences that sum to 3? Let's see. The entire array is [1,2,3]. The possible subsequences that sum to 3 are [1,2], [3], and [1,2,3] (sum is 6, which is not 3). Wait, no. Wait, 1+2=3, 3=3. So the subsequences are [1,2], [3]. So that's two. But the example says the entire array's power is 2. So maybe the example's explanation is wrong, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the power of a subsequence is the number of its own subsequences that sum to k. So for each possible subsequence S of the original array, we compute the number of subsequences of S that sum to k, and sum all those numbers.

So the problem is to compute, for every possible non-empty subsequence S of nums, the count of subsequences of S that sum to k, and sum all those counts.

Wait, but the example 1's explanation says that the entire array [1,2,3] contributes 2. Let's see: the subsequences of S (the entire array) that sum to 3 are [1,2] (sum 3) and [3] (sum 3). So that's two. So the entire array contributes 2. Then there are other subsequences of the original array, like [1,2], which is a subsequence of the original array. The subsequences of [1,2] that sum to 3 are [1,2], which is one. So that's another 1. Similarly, the subsequence [3] of the original array contributes 1. And the subsequence [1,3] (sum 4) would contribute 0. So the example's explanation is correct.

But how do we compute this efficiently? Because the original array can have up to 100 elements, which means the number of possible subsequences is 2^100, which is way too big to iterate through each one. So we need a dynamic programming approach.

Hmm. Let's think about the problem. For each subsequence S of the original array, we need to compute the number of subsequences of S that sum to k. Then sum all these numbers.

But how can we model this? Let's think of the problem in terms of generating all possible subsequences S of the original array, and for each S, compute the number of its subsequences that sum to k.

But the problem is that the number of S is 2^100, which is impossible. So we need a smarter way.

Alternative approach: Let's model the problem as follows. For each element in the array, we can choose to include it in the subsequence S or not. Then, for each possible S, we need to compute the number of subsequences of S that sum to k.

But this seems too vague. Let's think of the problem in terms of dynamic programming. Let's consider that when building the subsequence S, we can track some state that allows us to compute the contribution to the total sum.

Wait, perhaps we can model the problem by considering each element in the array and track the possible sums that can be formed by the elements included in S, and also track how many ways there are to form those sums. But how does that help in counting the number of subsequences of S that sum to k?

Alternatively, let's think of the problem as follows: For each possible subsequence S of the original array, the number of its subsequences that sum to k is equal to the number of pairs (A, B) where A is a subset of S, B is a subset of A, and the sum of elements in B is k. Wait, no. Because a subsequence of S is a subset of S where the elements are in order. But since S is a subsequence of the original array, the order is preserved. However, when considering subsequences of S, the order is the same as in S. But the sum is the same regardless of the order, so perhaps the order doesn't matter for the sum. So the sum of a subsequence of S is the sum of the elements in that subsequence, regardless of their order in S.

Wait, but the problem is about the sum of the elements. So the order of elements in S doesn't affect the sum. So when considering the subsequences of S, the sum is determined by the elements selected, not their order. So perhaps we can model the problem in terms of the elements in S, and their possible sums.

But even then, for each S, the number of subsequences of S that sum to k is equal to the number of subsets of S (excluding the empty set?) that sum to k. Wait, no. Because a subsequence can be any subset of S, but the order in S is preserved. However, the sum is the same as the sum of the elements in the subset. So the number of subsequences of S that sum to k is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of S that sum to k. Because each subset corresponds to exactly one subsequence (the elements in the same order as in S). Wait, no. For example, if S is [1,2,3], then the subset {1,3} can be formed as a subsequence by selecting the first and third elements. So the number of subsequences of S that sum to k is equal to the number of subsets of S (including empty?) that sum to k, but since the empty subset sums to 0, which is only considered if k is 0. But in the problem statement, k is a positive integer. So for each S, the number of subsequences of S that sum to k is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of S that sum to k. Because each non-empty subset of S corresponds to exactly one subsequence of S (the elements in the order they appear in S). So the count is the same as the number of subsets of S (excluding empty) that sum to k.

Wait, but the problem's example 1 says that the entire array [1,2,3] has 2 subsequences that sum to 3. Let's see: the subsets that sum to 3 are {1,2} (sum 3) and {3} (sum 3). So two subsets. So the count is 2. Which matches the example. So yes, the count is the number of non-empty subsets of S that sum to k.

So the problem reduces to: for each possible non-empty subsequence S of the original array, compute the number of non-empty subsets of S that sum to k, and sum all these counts.

But how to compute this efficiently?

The problem is that the original array can be up to 100 elements, which makes the number of possible S (subsequences) 2^100, which is way too big. So we need a way to compute this sum without enumerating all possible S.

Hmm. Let's think of the problem in terms of inclusion-exclusion. For each possible subset T of the original array (non-empty) that sums to k, how many times is T counted in the total sum? Because each T is a subset of some S, and for each S that includes T, T contributes 1 to the count of S's power. So the total sum is equal to the number of pairs (T, S) where T is a non-empty subset of S, S is a non-empty subsequence of the original array, and the sum of T is k.

But S is a subsequence of the original array, which is a subset of the elements in order. So T is a subset of S, which is a subset of the original array. So T is a subset of the original array, and S is a superset of T (since T is a subset of S). But S must be a subsequence of the original array, which is equivalent to being a subset of the elements in order. So for T to be a subset of S, the elements of T must appear in the original array in the same order as in T. Wait, no. Because S is a subsequence of the original array, which is a sequence of elements in order. So T is a subset of S, but the elements of T must appear in S in the same order as in the original array. So T is a subsequence of the original array as well. Wait, no. For example, if the original array is [1,2,3], and S is [1,3], then T could be [1,3], which is a subsequence of S. But T is also a subsequence of the original array. So in this case, T is a subsequence of the original array. So for any T that is a subset of S (as a subset, not considering order), T must be a subsequence of the original array. Because S is a subsequence of the original array, and T is a subset of S, which is ordered. So T is a subsequence of the original array.

Wait, perhaps not. For example, if the original array is [3,1,2], and S is [3,2], which is a subsequence. Then T could be [3,1], but that's not a subset of S. So T must be a subset of S, which is a subsequence. So T is a subset of S, which is a subsequence of the original array. So T is a subset of the original array, but not necessarily a subsequence. Wait, no. Because S is a subsequence, which is a sequence of elements in order. So any subset of S (as a subset, not considering order) would not necessarily form a subsequence. For example, S is [3,2], which is a subsequence of the original array [3,1,2]. Then T could be {3,1}, but that's not a subset of S. So T must be a subset of S, which is a subsequence. So T is a subset of S, which is a subsequence of the original array. So T is a subset of the original array, but not necessarily a subsequence. So the elements of T must appear in the original array in the same order as in T. Wait, no. Because S is a subsequence of the original array, which is ordered. So the elements of S are in the same order as in the original array. So any subset of S (as a subset, not considering order) would have elements that are in the same order as in the original array. For example, if S is [3,2], which is a subsequence of the original array [3,1,2], then the subset {2,3} is not a subset of S. But the subset {3,2} is a subset of S, but as a subset, the order doesn't matter. So the sum of the subset is 3+2=5, but the order in S is 3 followed by 2. So the subset {3,2} is considered as a subsequence of S, which is the same as the elements in S in order. So the sum is 5, but the order in the subset doesn't affect the sum.

So, the key point is that for each T (a subset of the original array that sums to k), how many S (subsequences of the original array) contain T as a subset, and T is a subset of S (as a subset, not considering order). Then, each such T contributes 1 to the power of S. So the total sum is the sum over all T (non-empty, sum k) of the number of S that are supersets of T (as a subset) and are subsequences of the original array.

Wait, but S is a subsequence of the original array. So S is a sequence of elements in the original array, in order. So T is a subset of S (as a subset, not considering order). So T can be any subset of the elements in S, but the elements of T must appear in S in the same order as in the original array. Wait, no. Because S is a subsequence, which is ordered. So the elements of S are in the same order as in the original array. So any subset of S (as a subset, not considering order) would have elements that are in the same order as in the original array. For example, if S is [3,2], which is a subsequence of the original array [3,1,2], then the subset {3,2} is a subset of S, and the elements are in the same order as in the original array. So the subset {3,2} is a valid subsequence of S. So the sum is 5. But in this case, the subset {3,2} is a subsequence of S, which is a subsequence of the original array.

So, the problem can be rephrased as: for each subset T of the original array (non-empty, sum k), count the number of subsequences S of the original array that include all elements of T (but not necessarily in the same order as T), and then sum all these counts.

Wait, no. Because T is a subset of S (as a subset, not considering order). So S must contain all elements of T, but the elements of T can be in any order in S. But since S is a subsequence of the original array, the elements of S are in the same order as in the original array. So T is a subset of S, but the elements of T can be in any order in S. Wait, no. Because S is a subsequence, which is ordered. So the elements of T must appear in S in the same order as in the original array. For example, if the original array is [1,3,2], and T is {3,2}, then S could be [1,3,2], which includes T. But if the original array is [1,2,3], and T is {3,2}, then S can't be a subsequence that includes both 3 and 2, because in the original array, 3 comes after 2. So S would have to be [2,3], which is a subsequence. Then T is a subset of S, and the elements of T are in the same order as in S. So in this case, T is a subset of S, and the elements of T are in the same order as in the original array.

So, for a subset T to be a subset of a subsequence S, the elements of T must appear in S in the same order as in the original array. So T is a subsequence of the original array. Because S is a subsequence, and T is a subset of S (as a subset, not considering order), but the elements of T must appear in S in the same order as in the original array. So T is a subsequence of the original array.

Wait, perhaps not. Let's take an example. Suppose the original array is [1,3,2]. T is the subset {3,2}. Then S can be [3,2], which is a subsequence. So T is a subset of S, and the elements of T are in the same order as in S, which is the same as the original array. So T is a subsequence of the original array. So in this case, T is a subsequence. But if the original array is [3,1,2], and T is {1,2}, then S can be [3,1,2], and T is a subset of S. But T is a subsequence of the original array. So in all cases, T must be a subsequence of the original array. Because S is a subsequence, and T is a subset of S (as a subset, not considering order), but the elements of T must appear in S in the same order as in the original array. So T is a subsequence of the original array.

Wait, but T is a subset of S, which is a subsequence. So the elements of T are a subset of S, but their order in S is the same as in the original array. So T is a subsequence of the original array. Because the elements of T are in the same order as in the original array, and T is a subset of S, which is a subsequence. So T is a subsequence of the original array.

So, the conclusion is that for each subset T of the original array that is a subsequence and sums to k, the number of S that are supersets of T (as a subset) and are subsequences of the original array is equal to 2^(m), where m is the number of elements not in T that appear after the last element of T in the original array. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think.

Suppose T is a subsequence of the original array. Then, to form a subsequence S that includes T as a subset, S must include all elements of T, and can include any subset of the elements that are not in T and appear after the last element of T. Because the elements of S must be in order. So, for example, if T is a subsequence ending at position i in the original array, then any elements after i can be included or not in S. But elements before i that are not in T can be included only if they are part of the elements that are in T. Wait, no. Because T is a subsequence, so the elements of T are in order. So, for example, if the original array is [a, b, c, d], and T is [a, c], then the elements after c (d) can be included or not in S. The elements between a and c (b) can be included in S only if they are part of T. But since T is [a, c], the elements between a and c (like b) are not in T, so they cannot be included in S. Because S is a subsequence that includes T. So S must include a and c, and can include any elements that come after c. So the elements that are not in T and are after the last element of T can be included or not. So the number of possible S that include T is 2^m, where m is the number of elements after the last element of T in the original array.

Wait, but what about elements that are not in T but are before the first element of T? For example, if T is [c, d], and the original array is [a, b, c, d]. Then, elements a and b are before c. So S must include c and d, but can include a and/or b? No, because S is a subsequence. So if S includes a, then a must come before c in the original array. But T is [c, d], which is a subsequence. So S can include a, but then a must be before c. But in that case, S would be [a, c, d], which is a valid subsequence. But T is [c, d], which is a subset of S. So in this case, the elements a and b (before T) can be included in S. So the number of possible S that include T is 2^(number of elements before the first element of T) multiplied by 2^(number of elements after the last element of T). Because for each element before the first element of T, we can choose to include it or not. Similarly for elements after the last element of T.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because the elements before the first element of T can be included in S only if they are part of the elements that are in S. But T is a subsequence, so the elements of T are in order. So, for example, if T is [c, d], then S can include any elements before c (like a and b) as long as they are included in S. But since S is a subsequence, the elements before c can be included in S only if they are in the original array before c. So the elements before the first element of T can be included or not in S. So the number of possible S that include T is 2^(number of elements before the first element of T) multiplied by 2^(number of elements after the last element of T). Because for each element before the first element of T, we can choose to include it or not. Similarly for elements after the last element of T.

So, for a given T (a subsequence of the original array that sums to k), the number of S that include T as a subset is 2^(a) * 2^(b), where a is the number of elements before the first element of T, and b is the number of elements after the last element of T. Because each of those elements can be included or not in S. But wait, the elements between the first and last elements of T can't be included unless they are part of T. Because T is a subsequence, and S must include all elements of T. So elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T can't be included in S. Because if they are included, then S would have to include them in the order of the original array, but T is a subsequence. For example, if T is [a, c], and the original array is [a, b, c], then S can be [a, c], which includes T. But if S includes b, then S would be [a, b, c], which includes T. But T is [a, c], which is a subset of S. So in this case, the element b is between a and c in the original array, but is not part of T. So S can include b. So the elements between the first and last elements of T can be included in S as long as they are in the original array between the first and last elements of T. So the number of possible S that include T is 2^(number of elements before the first element of T) multiplied by 2^(number of elements after the last element of T) multiplied by 2^(number of elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T). Because for each of those elements, we can choose to include them or not in S. Wait, but how?

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose the original array is [a, b, c, d], and T is [a, c]. The elements between a and c are b. So T is a subsequence. The elements before a: none. The elements after c: d. The elements between a and c: b. So the elements between a and c that are not in T is b. So for S to include T, S can include a, c, and any subset of the elements before a (none), any subset of the elements after c (d can be included or not), and any subset of the elements between a and c that are not in T (b can be included or not). So the number of possible S is 2^(0) * 2^(1) * 2^(1) = 2*2=4. So the possible S are:

- [a, c] (include none of b and d)
- [a, b, c] (include b, not d)
- [a, c, d] (include d, not b)
- [a, b, c, d] (include both b and d)

So yes, 4 possibilities. So the formula is correct.

So for a given T (a subsequence of the original array that sums to k), the number of S that include T as a subset is 2^(x) * 2^(y) * 2^(z), where x is the number of elements before the first element of T, y is the number of elements after the last element of T, and z is the number of elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T.

But how to compute x, y, z for a given T?

Alternatively, the total number of elements not in T is (n - |T|). But the elements not in T can be divided into three parts: those before the first element of T, those between the first and last elements of T, and those after the last element of T. The elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T can be included or not in S. So the number of possible S is 2^(x + y + z), where x is the number of elements before the first element of T, y is the number of elements after the last element of T, and z is the number of elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T.

But how to compute this for all possible T?

This seems complicated. So the problem reduces to:

For each subsequence T of the original array that sums to k, compute the number of possible S that include T as a subset (i.e., S is a superset of T, and S is a subsequence of the original array). Then sum all these counts.

So the total sum is the sum over all T (subsequences of the original array, sum k) of 2^(x + y + z), where x is the number of elements before the first element of T, y is the number of elements after the last element of T, and z is the number of elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T.

But how to compute this efficiently?

The key is to model this with dynamic programming, tracking the possible sums and the positions of the elements.

Let's think of the problem as follows: we can process the array element by element, and for each position, track the possible sums and the earliest and latest indices of the elements in the current subset. But this seems difficult.

Alternative approach: For each element in the array, we can decide whether to include it in T or not. But T is a subsequence that sums to k. For each such T, we need to compute the number of S that include T as a subset. So the problem is to find all possible T (subsequences summing to k) and compute the product of 2^(number of elements not in T that can be included in S).

But how to model this with dynamic programming.

Another idea: The number of S that include T is equal to 2^(number of elements not in T that are not between the first and last elements of T). Wait, no. Because elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T can be included or not. So the total is 2^(x + y + z), where x is elements before first of T, y is elements after last of T, z is elements between first and last of T not in T.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, the number of elements not in T is (n - |T|). But the elements not in T can be divided into three groups: before the first element of T, between the first and last elements of T, and after the last element of T. The elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T can be included or not in S. So the number of possible S is 2^(x + y + z), where x is the number of elements before the first element of T, y is the number of elements after the last element of T, and z is the number of elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T.

But how to compute this for all possible T.

Hmm. Let's think of the problem in terms of dynamic programming. We can model the state as follows:

We process the array from left to right. For each position i, and for each possible sum s, we track the earliest and latest positions of the elements in the current subset. But this seems too complex.

Alternative idea: For each position i in the array, and for each possible sum s, track the number of ways to form subsets that end at i with sum s, and also track the number of elements that can be included or not in S. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think of the problem as follows: For each element in the array, we can choose to include it in T or not. If we include it in T, then we need to track the sum and the positions. But this seems challenging.

Another approach: Let's consider that the number of S that include T is equal to 2^(number of elements not in T that are not between the first and last elements of T). Wait, no. Because elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T can be included or not. So the total is 2^(x + y + z), where x is elements before first of T, y is elements after last of T, and z is elements between first and last of T not in T.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, the number of elements not in T is (n - |T|). But the elements not in T can be divided into three parts: before the first element of T, between the first and last elements of T, and after the last element of T. The elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T can be included or not in S. So the number of possible S is 2^(x + y + z), where x is the number of elements before the first element of T, y is the number of elements after the last element of T, and z is the number of elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T.

But how to compute this for all possible T.

Hmm. Let's think of the problem in terms of the positions of the elements in T. Suppose T is a subsequence with elements at positions p_0, p_1, ..., p_m-1. Then, the elements before p_0 can be included or not in S. The elements after p_{m-1} can be included or not. The elements between p_0 and p_{m-1} that are not in T can be included or not. So the number of possible S is 2^{(p_0) + (n - p_{m-1} - 1) + (sum_{i=1 to m-1} (p_i - p_{i-1} - 1) - (m-1 - i)) )} }.

Wait, perhaps not. Let's take an example. Suppose T is [a, c] in the array [a, b, c, d]. The positions are 0 and 2. The elements before p_0 (0) are none. The elements after p_{m-1} (2) are d (position 3). The elements between p_0 and p_{m-1} (positions 0 and 2) are b (position 1). So the elements between are 1 element (b), which is not in T. So z is 1. So the number of possible S is 2^(0 + 1 + 1) = 4, which matches the example.

So the formula is correct.

But how to compute this for all possible T.

This seems very challenging. So perhaps we need to find a way to model the problem with dynamic programming, tracking the necessary information.

Let's think of the problem as follows: We can model the dynamic programming state as (current index, current sum, first index of the current subset, last index of the current subset). But this would be O(n^4 * k) time and space, which is feasible for n=100 and k=100. Because 100^4 is 1e8, multiplied by 100 gives 1e10, which is way too big.

Alternative idea: For each position i, and for each possible sum s, track the number of ways to form subsets that end at i with sum s, and also track the number of elements that can be included in S. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think of the problem as follows: For each element in the array, we can choose to include it in T or not. If we include it in T, then we need to track the sum and the first and last indices of T. But this seems difficult.

Another approach: Let's precompute for each possible subset T (sum k) the number of S that include T. Then sum all these counts.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Alternative idea: The number of S that include T is equal to 2^(number of elements not in T that are not between the first and last elements of T). So for each T, the count is 2^{x + y + z}, where x is the number of elements before the first element of T, y is the number of elements after the last element of T, and z is the number of elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T.

But how to compute this for all T.

Hmm. Let's think of the problem in terms of the first and last elements of T. For each possible pair of indices (i, j) where i <= j, and the sum of the elements in T is k, and T is a subsequence starting at i and ending at j. Then, the count for this T is 2^{(i) + (n - j - 1) + (number of elements between i and j not in T)}.

But how to compute the number of elements between i and j not in T.

Alternatively, the number of elements between i and j is (j - i - 1). The number of elements in T between i and j is (m-1), where m is the length of T. So the number of elements between i and j not in T is (j - i - 1) - (m-1 - 1) = j - i -1 - (m-2) = j -i - m +1. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, the number of elements between i and j (exclusive) is (j - i -1). The number of elements in T between i and j is (m-1) elements (since T starts at i and ends at j). So the number of elements between i and j not in T is (j - i -1) - (m-1 - 0) = j -i -1 - (m-1) = j -i -m.

But this depends on the length of T. So for a given i and j, and a given T that starts at i and ends at j, the number of elements between i and j not in T is (j -i -1) - (number of elements in T between i and j). But the number of elements in T between i and j is (m-1), where m is the length of T. So this seems difficult to model.

Alternative idea: For each possible pair of indices (i, j), where i <= j, and the sum of the elements in the subsequence from i to j (not necessarily contiguous) is k. Then, the count for this T is 2^{(i) + (n - j -1) + (number of elements between i and j not in T)}.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, the number of elements between i and j not in T is (j -i -1) - (number of elements in T between i and j). But the number of elements in T between i and j is (m-1), where m is the length of T. So this is (j -i -1) - (m-1) = j -i -m.

But how to model this.

This seems very complicated. So perhaps we need to find a different approach.

Let's think of the problem in terms of the original array. For each element, we can choose to include it in T or not. If we include it in T, then we need to track the sum and the first and last indices of T. But this seems difficult.

Alternative approach inspired by the standard subset sum problem:

We can model the problem using dynamic programming where we track the possible sums and the first and last indices of the subsets. For each position i in the array, and for each possible sum s, we can track the number of ways to form subsets that end at i with sum s, and also track the earliest and latest indices of the subset. But this would require a 4-dimensional DP, which is not feasible.

Alternative idea: Let's consider that the number of S that include T is equal to 2^(number of elements not in T that are not between the first and last elements of T). So for each T, the count is 2^{x + y + z}, where x is the number of elements before the first element of T, y is the number of elements after the last element of T, and z is the number of elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T.

But how to compute this for all T.

Another idea: For each possible first and last element of T, and for each possible sum, track the number of ways to form T with those first and last elements and sum s. Then, for each such T, compute the count as 2^{x + y + z} and multiply by the number of ways to form T.

But how to compute x, y, z.

Let's say the first element of T is at index i, and the last element is at index j. The sum of T is s. Then, the number of elements before i is i elements (since the array is 0-based). The number of elements after j is (n - j - 1). The number of elements between i and j is (j - i - 1). The number of elements in T between i and j is (m-1), where m is the length of T. So the number of elements between i and j not in T is (j -i -1) - (m-1) = j -i - m.

But how to track m, the length of T.

This seems challenging. So perhaps we need to model the DP with additional parameters.

Alternative approach inspired by the standard subset sum problem with counting:

We can use a dynamic programming approach where we track the possible sums and the number of ways to achieve them, but also track the first and last indices of the subsets. However, this would require a 3-dimensional DP (sum, first index, last index), which is feasible for n=100 and k=100.

Let's define dp[i][s][f][l] as the number of subsets that end at index i, have sum s, and have first index f and last index l. But this is a 4-dimensional DP, which is not feasible for n=100.

Alternative idea: We can track for each sum s, and for each possible first and last index, the number of subsets that have sum s and start at first and end at last. But this is still O(n^2 * k) space, which is manageable for n=100 and k=100.

So the DP state can be represented as a dictionary where for each sum s, we have a dictionary of (first, last) pairs to the count of subsets with sum s, first index f, last index l.

We can initialize the DP with each element as a subset of size 1. For example, for each i, if nums[i] == k, then we have a subset starting and ending at i with sum k, count 1.

Then, for each subsequent element j, we can iterate through all possible existing subsets and see if adding nums[j] to them would create a new subset with sum s + nums[j], and update the first and last indices accordingly.

But this approach would have a time complexity of O(n^2 * k), which is acceptable for n=100 and k=100.

Once we have this DP, for each subset T (sum k) with first index f and last index l, the count of S that include T is 2^(f) * 2^(n - l - 1) * 2^( (l - f - 1) - (m-1) ), where m is the length of T. But m is (l - f + 1) if T is a contiguous subsequence, but T is a subsequence, not necessarily contiguous. So m is the number of elements in T, which is not directly related to f and l.

Wait, this is a problem. Because the length of T is not known from f and l. For example, T could be [a, c] with f=0 and l=2, but the length is 2. So the number of elements between f and l is 1 (element at index 1), but the number of elements in T between f and l is 0. So the formula would be 2^(0) * 2^(n - 2 -1) * 2^(1 - 0) = 1 * 2^(n-3) * 2^1 = 2^(n-2). But in the example where the array is [a, b, c, d], and T is [a, c], the count is 4, which is 2^2. So for n=4, 2^(4-2) =4, which matches.

So the formula seems to work. But how to compute the number of elements between f and l not in T.

The number of elements between f and l is (l - f -1). The number of elements in T between f and l is (m-1), where m is the length of T. So the number of elements between f and l not in T is (l - f -1) - (m-1) = l -f - m.

But how to track m, the length of T.

This is a problem. Because in the DP state, we track the first and last indices, but not the length. So we can't compute m.

Alternative idea: The length of T is (last - first + 1) if T is a contiguous subsequence. But T is a subsequence, not necessarily contiguous. So this is not possible.

Hmm. So this approach may not work.

Alternative approach: Let's think of the problem differently. For each element in the array, we can choose to include it in T or not. If we include it in T, then we need to track the sum and the first and last indices of T. But this seems difficult.

Another idea: The number of elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T is equal to the total number of elements between first and last minus the number of elements in T between first and last. But the number of elements in T between first and last is (m-1), where m is the length of T. But since T is a subsequence, the elements between first and last can be any subset of the elements between first and last in the original array, as long as they form a subsequence. So this seems difficult to model.

Alternative approach inspired by the standard problem of counting the number of subsequences that sum to k:

In the standard problem, we can use a DP where dp[i][s] is the number of subsequences that sum to s using the first i elements. The recurrence is dp[i][s] = dp[i-1][s] + dp[i-1][s - nums[i-1]].

But in this problem, we need to consider all possible subsets T of the original array that sum to k, and for each T, compute the number of S that include T as a subset. So the total sum is the sum over all T (sum k) of the number of S that include T.

So the total sum is equal to the sum over all T (sum k) of 2^{x + y + z}, where x is the number of elements before the first element of T, y is the number of elements after the last element of T, and z is the number of elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T.

But how to compute this.

Another idea: For each element in the array, we can track the possible sums and the positions of the first and last elements of the subsets. Then, for each subset T that sums to k, we can compute the count as 2^{x + y + z} and multiply by the number of such subsets.

But how to track the first and last elements.

Let's try to model this with a DP that tracks for each sum s, the number of subsets that sum to s, and for each such subset, the first and last indices. But this is not feasible for large n.

Alternative idea: For each position i, and for each possible sum s, track the number of subsets that end at i with sum s, and also track the earliest index of the subset. Then, for each such subset, the earliest index is f, and the latest index is i. The number of elements before f is f elements. The number of elements after i is (n - i - 1). The number of elements between f and i is (i - f - 1). The number of elements in the subset between f and i is (m-1), where m is the length of the subset. So the number of elements between f and i not in the subset is (i - f -1) - (m-1) = i -f - m.

But again, we don't know m.

This seems like a dead end.

Alternative approach: Let's think of the problem in terms of the standard subset sum problem. For each subset T that sums to k, the number of S that include T is 2^{x + y + z}, where x is the number of elements before the first element of T, y is the number of elements after the last element of T, and z is the number of elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T.

But how to compute this sum.

Another idea: The total sum can be expressed as the sum over all possible pairs (i, j) where i <= j, and the sum of the elements in the subsequence from i to j (not necessarily contiguous) is k, multiplied by 2^{(i) + (n - j -1) + (number of elements between i and j not in the subsequence)}.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, the number of elements between i and j not in the subsequence is (j - i -1) - (number of elements in the subsequence between i and j). But the number of elements in the subsequence between i and j is (m-1), where m is the length of the subsequence. So this is (j -i -1) - (m-1) = j -i - m.

But again, we don't know m.

Hmm. This seems very challenging. Perhaps there's a different way to model the problem.

Let's think of the problem in terms of the standard subset sum problem. For each element, we can choose to include it in T or not. If we include it in T, then we need to track the sum and the first and last indices of T. But this seems difficult.

Alternative idea inspired by the inclusion-exclusion principle:

The total sum is equal to the sum over all possible subsets T of the original array (sum k) of the number of S that include T as a subset. So this is equivalent to the sum over all T (sum k) of 2^{number of elements not in T that are not between the first and last elements of T}.

But how to compute this.

Another idea: For each element in the array, we can compute how many times it is included in T and how many times it is not. But this is not directly helpful.

Alternatively, the total sum can be expressed as the sum over all possible pairs (i, j) where i <= j, and the sum of the elements in the subsequence from i to j (not necessarily contiguous) is k, multiplied by 2^{(i) + (n - j -1) + (number of elements between i and j not in the subsequence)}.

But how to compute this.

Let's think of the problem in terms of the standard subset sum problem. We can use a dynamic programming approach where we track the possible sums and the first and last indices of the subsets. For each element, we can choose to include it in the subset or not. If we include it, we update the sum, first index, and last index.

But this would require a 3-dimensional DP: sum, first index, last index. For each possible sum s, and for each possible first index f and last index l, we track the number of subsets that sum to s, start at f, and end at l.

The recurrence would be:

For each element at index i, for each possible sum s, and for each possible (f, l) pair:

- If we don't include the current element, the state remains the same.
- If we include the current element, then the new sum is s + nums[i]. The new first index is min(f, i) if the subset is new, or f if it's already part of the subset. Wait, no. If the current element is included, then the new subset's first index is the minimum of the previous first index and i. But this is not correct. For example, if the previous subset starts at f and ends at l, and we include the current element i, then the new subset's first index is f if i is after l, or i if i is before f. But this is not possible because the subset must be a subsequence. So the elements must be in order. So if the previous subset starts at f and ends at l, and we include the current element i, then i must be after l. Because the subset is a subsequence. So the new subset's first index is f, and the new last index is i.

Wait, no. Because the subset is a subsequence, which is ordered. So when we include a new element, it must be after the previous last index. So the new subset's first index is the same as the previous subset's first index, and the new last index is i.

So the DP state can be represented as (sum, first, last), and for each element i, we can choose to include it in the subset if i > last. Then, the new sum is sum + nums[i], the new first is first, and the new last is i.

Alternatively, if the subset is empty, then including the current element i creates a subset with sum nums[i], first i, last i.

So the DP transitions would be:

For each element i in the array:

- For each state (s, f, l) in the current DP:

   - If we don't include i, the state remains (s, f, l).

   - If we include i, and i > l (so that the subset remains a subsequence), then we create a new state (s + nums[i], f, i). The count for this new state is increased by the count of the current state.

   - Also, if the subset is empty (f and l are None), then including i creates a new state (nums[i], i, i) with count 1.

But this approach would track all possible subsets that are subsequences. Then, for each state (s, f, l) where s = k, the count is the number of subsets T that sum to k, start at f, and end at l. For each such T, the number of S that include T is 2^{(f) + (n - l - 1) + (number of elements between f and l not in T)}.

But how to compute the number of elements between f and l not in T.

The number of elements between f and l is (l - f - 1). The number of elements in T between f and l is (m-1), where m is the length of T. But the length of T is (l - f + 1) if T is a contiguous subsequence, but T is a subsequence, so the length is the number of elements in T. So this approach doesn't track the length of T.

So this seems like a dead end.

Alternative idea: The number of elements between f and l not in T is (l - f - 1) - (number of elements in T between f and l). But the number of elements in T between f and l is (m-1), where m is the length of T. But since T is a subsequence, the elements between f and l in T can be any subset of the elements between f and l in the original array, as long as they form a subsequence. So this is difficult to track.

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Another idea: The total sum is equal to the sum over all possible subsets T of the original array (sum k) of the number of S that include T as a subset. So this is equivalent to the sum over all T (sum k) of 2^{number of elements not in T that are not between the first and last elements of T}.

But how to compute this.

Wait, the number of elements not in T that are not between the first and last elements of T is equal to the number of elements before the first element of T plus the number of elements after the last element of T plus the number of elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T.

So the count for T is 2^{x + y + z}, where x is the number of elements before the first element of T, y is the number of elements after the last element of T, and z is the number of elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T.

But how to compute this for all T.

Another idea: For each element in the array, we can compute the contribution of all subsets T that include this element. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think of the problem as follows: For each element in the array, the number of times it is included in T is equal to the number of subsets T that include it and sum to k. Then, for each such T, the element's contribution to the total sum is 2^{x + y + z}, where x, y, z are as before. But this seems difficult.

At this point, I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should look for a different approach inspired by the standard subset sum problem.

Let's think of the problem in terms of the standard subset sum problem. We can use a dynamic programming approach where we track the number of subsets that sum to s, and for each such subset, track the first and last indices. But this is not feasible for large n.

The total sum is the sum over all T (sum k) of 2^{x + y + z}.

But how to compute this sum.

Another idea: The sum can be rewritten as the product of three terms: 2^x * 2^y * 2^z. So the total sum is the sum over all T (sum k) of 2^{x + y + z} = sum over T (sum k) of 2^{x} * 2^{y} * 2^{z}.

But x is the number of elements before the first element of T. So for each T, x is the index of the first element of T. Similarly, y is the number of elements after the last element of T, which is (n - last_index - 1). z is the number of elements between first and last indices not in T.

But how to compute this.

Another idea: For each possible first index f and last index l (f <= l), compute the number of subsets T that start at f, end at l, sum to k, and have a certain number of elements between f and l not in T. Then, for each such T, the count is 2^{f} * 2^{n - l - 1} * 2^{z}, where z is the number of elements between f and l not in T.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, the count for a subset T with first index f and last index l is 2^{f} * 2^{n - l - 1} * 2^{(l - f - 1) - (m-1)} }, where m is the number of elements in T between f and l. But m is the length of T minus 1 (since T starts at f and ends at l). So m is the number of elements in T between f and l plus 1 (the elements f and l).

But this is not helpful.

Let's define dp[i][s][f][l] as the number of subsets that sum to s using the first i elements, with first index f and last index l. But this is a 4-dimensional DP, which is not feasible.

For each subset T that sums to k, the count is 2^{x + y + z}, where x is the number of elements before the first element of T, y is the number of elements after the last element of T, and z is the number of elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T.

But how to compute this.

Another idea: The sum can be rewritten as the product of three terms: 2^x * 2^y * 2^z. So the total sum is the sum over all T (sum k) of 2^{x} * 2^{y} * 2^{z}.

But x is the number of elements before the first element of T. So for each T, x is the index of the first element of T. Similarly, y is the number of elements after the last element of T, which is (n - last_index - 1). z is the number of elements between first and last indices not in T.

But how to compute this.

Another idea: For each possible first index f and last index l (f <= l), compute the number of subsets T that start at f, end at l, sum to k, and have a certain number of elements between f and l not in T. Then, for each such T, the count is 2^{f} * 2^{n - l - 1} * 2^{(l - f - 1) - (m-1)} }, where m is the number of elements in T between f and l. But m is the length of T minus 1 (since T starts at f and ends at l). So m is the number of elements in T between f and l plus 1 (the elements f and l).

But this is not helpful.

Another idea: The sum can be rewritten as the product of three terms: 2^x * 2^y * 2^z. So the total sum is the sum over all T (sum k) of 2^{x} * 2^{y} * 2^{z}.

But x is the number of elements before the first element of T. So for each T, x is the index of the first element of T. Similarly, y is the number of elements after the last element of T, which is (n - last_index - 1). z is the number of elements between first and last indices not in T.

Another idea: For each possible first index f and last index l (f <= l), compute the number of subsets T that start at f, end at l, sum to k, and have a certain number of elements between f and l not in T. Then, for each such T, the count is 2^{f} * 2^{n - l - 1} * 2^{(l - f - 1) - (m-1)} }, where m is the number of elements in T between f and l. But m is the length of T minus 1 (since T starts at f and ends at l). So m is the number of elements in T between f and l plus 1 (the elements f and l).

But x is the number of elements before the first element of T. So for each T, x is the index of the first element of T. Similarly, y is the number of elements after the last element of T, which is (n - last_index - 1). z is the number of elements between first and last indices not in T.

But how to compute this.

Another idea: For each possible first index f and last index l (f <= l), compute the number of subsets T that start at f, end at l, sum to k, and have a certain number of elements between f and l not in T. Then, for each such T, the count is 2^{f} * 2^{n - l - 1} * 2^{(l - f - 1) - (m-1)} }, where m is the number of elements in T between f and l. But m is the length of T minus 1 (since T starts at f and ends at l). So m is the number of elements in T between f and l plus 1 (the elements f and l).

But this is not helpful.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think I need to look for a different approach.

Let's think of the problem in terms of the standard subset sum problem. For each subset T that sums to k, the count is 2^{x + y + z}, where x is the number of elements before the first element of T, y is the number of elements after the last element of T, and z is the number of elements between the first and last elements of T that are not in T.

Another idea: For each element in the array, we can compute the contribution of all subsets T that include this element. But I'm not sure.
