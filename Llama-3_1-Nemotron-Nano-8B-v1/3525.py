<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to find the maximum total energy boost by choosing between two drinks each hour, but if I switch, I lose the next hour's boost. Hmm. So the problem is similar to some dynamic programming problem where the state depends on previous choices.

Let me think about the examples. In the first example, energyDrinkA is [1,3,1], B is [3,1,1]. The best is to choose all A, which gives 1+3+1=5. Or all B gives 3+1+1=5. So the maximum is 5. But if you switch, like A then B then A, you might not get better. Because switching from A to B would cost the second hour. So for example, A (1) then B (lose second hour) then B (third hour 1) gives 1 + 0 +1 =2, which is worse.

In the second example, A is [4,1,1], B is [1,1,3]. The optimal is A, then B (but lose second hour), then B. So total is 4 + 0 +3 =7. If you just take A all the way, it's 4+1+1=6. If you take B all the way, 1+1+3=5. So switching once gives a better result.

So the key is to track whether we are currently on A or B, and decide whether to switch or not. But since the problem allows starting with either, we need to track the last choice.

Dynamic programming seems like the way to go here. Let's model the state as two variables: the maximum energy up to the current hour if we are on A, and the maximum if we are on B.

For each hour i, we can compute the new values based on the previous hour's values.

At each step i:

- If we are on A at i, we can either stay on A (add energyDrinkA[i]) or switch from B (but then we have to skip the previous hour's choice, because switching requires a cooldown. Wait, no. Wait, the cooldown is when you switch. So if you switch from A to B, you have to wait for one hour. Wait, the problem says: if you switch from consuming one to the other, you need to wait for one hour to cleanse your system. So during that hour, you don't get any energy boost.

Wait, the problem says: you can start with either. Then, each hour, you choose which drink to take. But if you switch from the previous drink, you have to wait for one hour (i.e., the current hour is the switch, so you can't take the next drink in the next hour). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the problem says: if you want to switch from consuming one energy drink to the other, you need to wait for one hour to cleanse your system (meaning you won't get any energy boost in that hour).

So, for example, if you take A in hour 1, then in hour 2 you switch to B, then in hour 2 you can't take any drink (because you switched, so you have to wait for an hour). Wait, no. Wait, the switching happens when you change from one to the other. So when you switch, the next hour you can't take a drink. Or is it that the hour when you switch is the one where you can't take a drink?

Wait, the problem says: if you switch, you need to wait for one hour. So during that hour, you don't get any energy. So for example, if you take A in hour i, then in hour i+1 you switch to B, then you can't take any drink in hour i+1. Then in hour i+2, you can take B. So the total would be A[i] + B[i+2].

Wait, maybe the way it works is that when you switch, the next hour is a cooldown. So the decision to switch affects the next hour. So the state needs to track whether the previous action was a switch, which would require the current hour to be a cooldown.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that when you switch from one drink to another, the next hour you can't take any drink. So for example:

If you take A in hour 0, then switch to B in hour 1, then you can't take any drink in hour 1 (because you switched), and then in hour 2 you can take B. So the total would be A[0] + B[2].

Wait, but the problem's example 2 shows that after switching, you can take the next drink. Let's look at example 2:

Input: A = [4,1,1], B = [1,1,3]

The optimal path is:

Hour 1: take A (4). Then switch to B. So in hour 2, you can't take any drink (because you switched in hour 1). Then in hour 3, take B (3). So total is 4 + 0 (hour 2) +3 =7.

Wait, but the example's explanation says: drink A first hour, switch to B (so lose second hour), gain third. So the cooldown is the hour after the switch. So when you switch in hour i, you can't take any drink in hour i+1. So the cooldown is the next hour.

So the way to model this is: whenever you switch, the next hour is a cooldown (no energy). So the state needs to track whether the next hour is a cooldown.

Alternatively, perhaps the cooldown is the same hour as the switch. For example, if you switch in hour i, then during hour i you can't take any drink. But that's not possible because you have to take a drink each hour. Wait, the problem says you can start with either, and each hour you drink one. But if you switch, you have to wait for one hour to cleanse. So during that hour, you can't get any energy. So the process is: each hour, you choose which drink to take. But if you switch from the previous drink, then during that hour, you can't take any. Wait, that's confusing.

Wait, the problem statement says: "if you want to switch from consuming one energy drink to the other, you need to wait for one hour to cleanse your system (meaning you won't get any energy boost in that hour)."

So, when you switch, you have to wait for one hour. So during that hour, you can't get any energy. So the act of switching causes you to lose the next hour's energy. So for example:

If you take A in hour 1, then in hour 2 you decide to switch to B. Then, in hour 2, you can't take any drink (because you switched), so you get 0. Then in hour 3, you can take B. So the total would be A[1] + 0 (hour 2) + B[3].

Wait, but how does the switching work? Let me rephrase the problem statement.

Each hour, you can choose to take either drink. However, if you switch from the previous hour's drink (i.e., you took A in hour i-1 and take B in hour i, or vice versa), then you have to wait for one hour. That hour (hour i) is the cooldown, and you get 0 energy. So the next hour (i+1) you can take the new drink.

Wait, no. The problem says that when you switch, you need to wait for one hour. So during that hour, you can't get any energy. So the act of switching causes you to lose the next hour's energy. So for example:

If you take A in hour i, then in hour i+1 you switch to B. Then, in hour i+1, you can't take any drink (because you switched), so you get 0. Then in hour i+2, you can take B.

Wait, but how does the switching happen? Let's think of the steps:

At each hour, you can choose to take the same drink as the previous hour, or switch. If you switch, then during the current hour, you can't take any drink. Wait, that's not possible because you have to take a drink each hour. So perhaps the problem is that when you switch, you have to wait for the next hour, during which you can't take any drink. So the process is:

- You start with either A or B in hour 1.

- For each subsequent hour, you can choose to take the same drink as before, or switch.

- If you switch, then the next hour (the one after the switch) is a cooldown, where you can't take any drink. So the switch causes the next hour to be a cooldown.

Wait, but how does that fit into the example 2?

In example 2:

n=3. So hours 0,1,2 (assuming 0-based index).

The optimal path is:

Hour 0: take A (4). Then switch to B. So in hour 1, you can't take any drink (cooldown). Then in hour 2, take B (3). So total is 4 + 0 +3 =7.

But how does the switch happen? The switch is made in hour 0, so the cooldown is hour 1. Then in hour 2, you can take B.

So the cooldown is the next hour after the switch.

So the model is: when you switch in hour i, you can't take any drink in hour i+1. So the state needs to track whether the next hour is a cooldown.

So for dynamic programming, the state can be:

- The current index.

- The last drink taken (A or B).

- Whether the next hour is a cooldown.

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the state can track the last drink taken and whether we are in a cooldown.

Wait, but the cooldown is only for the next hour. So after a switch, the next hour is a cooldown. So the state can be:

At each step i, the state is:

- The last drink taken (A or B).

- Whether the current hour is a cooldown.

But how does that work? Let's think.

For example, if in hour i, you are in a cooldown, then you can't take any drink. So you have to skip this hour, and the next hour is not a cooldown. So the state transitions would be:

If current state is (last_drink, cooldown=True), then in the next hour, you can't take any drink, so you have to skip. So the next state would be (last_drink, cooldown=False), but you get 0 energy for the current hour.

Wait, but how do you model this? Let's think of the DP approach.

Let's model the DP as two arrays (or variables, since we can optimize space) for each hour i:

dpA[i] = maximum energy up to hour i if we are taking A at hour i.

dpB[i] = maximum energy up to hour i if we are taking B at hour i.

But how to handle the cooldown?

Wait, when you take a drink in hour i, you can either take the same as the previous or switch. But switching would require that the previous hour's drink was different, and that you are not in a cooldown.

Alternatively, perhaps the cooldown is a state that affects the next step.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to track for each hour i, the maximum energy if we are on A or B, and whether we are in a cooldown.

But that's getting complicated. Let's think again.

Alternative approach: For each hour i, the decision to take A or B depends on the previous choice. If the previous choice was A, then taking A again adds A[i], taking B would require that the next hour is a cooldown. Wait, no. Wait, the cooldown is the next hour after the switch.

So, if in hour i, you take B (and previously took A), then in hour i+1, you can't take any drink. So the energy for hour i is B[i], but then hour i+1 is 0, and hour i+2 can be taken as B (since the cooldown was only for hour i+1).

Wait, but how does this affect the DP transitions?

Let me think of the transitions.

At hour i, if you are on A, then for the next hour i+1:

- If you take A again, then you can add A[i+1] to the current total.

- If you switch to B, then you can add B[i+1], but then you have to skip hour i+1 (since you switched). Wait, no. Wait, when you switch, you have to wait for one hour. So the hour when you switch is the one where you can't take any drink. So for example:

If you take A in hour i, then switch to B in hour i+1. Then, in hour i+1, you can't take any drink. So the energy for hour i+1 is 0, and in hour i+2, you can take B.

But how does that fit into the transitions?

Alternatively, perhaps the cooldown is the next hour after the switch. So when you switch from A to B in hour i, then in hour i+1, you can't take any drink, and in hour i+2, you can take B.

But how to model this in DP.

Alternatively, perhaps the cooldown is the same hour as the switch. For example, if you switch in hour i, then during hour i, you can't take any drink. But that's not possible because you have to take a drink each hour.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's re-examine the problem statement.

Problem statement says: if you switch from consuming one energy drink to the other, you need to wait for one hour to cleanse your system (meaning you won't get any energy boost in that hour).

So, when you switch, you have to wait for one hour. So during that hour, you can't get any energy. So the act of switching causes you to lose the next hour's energy.

So, for example:

If you take A in hour i, then in hour i+1, you switch to B. Then, in hour i+1, you can't take any drink (because you switched), so you get 0. Then in hour i+2, you can take B.

But how does the switching happen? The switch is made in hour i+1, which is the same as the cooldown hour. So the process is:

- Take A in hour i.

- In hour i+1, decide to switch to B. But during hour i+1, you can't take any drink. So you get 0 energy for that hour, and then in hour i+2, you can take B.

But how does this affect the transitions in the DP?

Alternatively, perhaps the cooldown is the hour after the switch. So when you switch in hour i, the next hour (i+1) is a cooldown. So in hour i+1, you can't take any drink, and then in hour i+2, you can take the new drink.

But how to model this in the DP.

Let me think of the DP states. For each hour i, the state can be:

- The last drink taken (A or B).

- Whether the next hour is a cooldown.

But this might be too complex. Alternatively, perhaps the state can track the last drink taken and whether we are in a cooldown.

Wait, but the cooldown is only for the next hour. So after a switch, the next hour is a cooldown.

So, for example:

If in hour i, you take A, then in hour i+1, you can take A again (no cooldown) or switch to B (which would cause a cooldown in hour i+1, but you can't take any drink there). Wait, no. If you switch in hour i+1, then during hour i+1, you can't take any drink. So the process is:

At hour i, you take A. Then, in hour i+1, you can choose to take A again (so no cooldown) or switch to B. If you switch to B in hour i+1, then during hour i+1, you can't take any drink. So the energy for hour i+1 is 0, and in hour i+2, you can take B.

But how to model this in the DP.

Alternatively, perhaps the cooldown is a state that affects the next step. So, for each hour i, the state is:

- The last drink taken (A or B).

- Whether the current hour is a cooldown.

But how does the cooldown work?

Wait, perhaps the cooldown is a state that says that in the current hour, you can't take any drink. So, for example:

If you are in a cooldown state at hour i, then you can't take any drink. So you have to skip this hour, and the next hour is not a cooldown. So the state transitions would be:

If current state is (last_drink, cooldown=True), then in the next hour, you can't take any drink. So the next state is (last_drink, cooldown=False), but you get 0 energy for the current hour.

But how does this fit into the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the cooldown is a state that applies to the next hour. For example, if you switch in hour i, then in hour i+1, you are in a cooldown state. So during hour i+1, you can't take any drink, and the next state (i+2) is not a cooldown.

So, the DP state can be:

At hour i, the state is (last_drink, cooldown). The cooldown is a boolean indicating whether the current hour is a cooldown.

But how to model this.

Let me try to model the DP transitions.

For each hour i from 0 to n-1:

If the current state is (A, False) (meaning last drink was A, and not in cooldown):

- You can take A again: add A[i] to the total. The next state is (A, False).

- Or switch to B: add B[i] to the total. But then, the next hour (i+1) is a cooldown. So the next state is (B, True). But wait, no. Because when you switch to B in hour i, the cooldown is for hour i+1. So in hour i+1, you can't take any drink. So the state after switching would be (B, True) for hour i+1.

Wait, perhaps the state (last_drink, cooldown) represents the state for the current hour. So:

If in hour i, the state is (A, False), then you can take A again, leading to (A, False) in hour i+1, adding A[i].

Or you can switch to B, leading to (B, True) in hour i+1, adding B[i]. But then, in hour i+1, you are in a cooldown state, so you can't take any drink. So the energy for hour i+1 is 0, but the state transitions to (B, False) in hour i+2.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think of the transitions step by step.

Let's model the DP as follows:

We have two variables, dpA and dpB, which represent the maximum energy up to the current hour if we are on A or B, respectively, and not in a cooldown.

But when we switch, the next hour is a cooldown. So, for example:

If we are on A at hour i, and switch to B, then in hour i+1, we can't take any drink. So the energy for hour i+1 is 0, and in hour i+2, we can take B.

But how to model this in the DP.

Alternatively, perhaps the DP should track the maximum energy up to hour i, considering whether the next hour is a cooldown.

So, for each hour i, we track two possibilities:

- The maximum energy if we are on A and not in a cooldown.

- The maximum energy if we are on B and not in a cooldown.

But when we switch, the next hour is a cooldown. So, for example:

If we are on A at hour i, and switch to B, then in hour i+1, we can't take any drink. So the energy for hour i+1 is 0, and in hour i+2, we can take B.

But how to model this in the transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the DP can track the maximum energy up to hour i, and for each state (A or B), whether the next hour is a cooldown.

So, for each hour i, we have four possible states:

- On A, next hour is not a cooldown.

- On A, next hour is a cooldown.

- On B, next hour is not a cooldown.

- On B, next hour is a cooldown.

But this might be too complex. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the cooldown is only possible when you switch. So, when you switch, the next hour is a cooldown. So, the state can be (current_drink, cooldown_next). So, for each hour i, the state is (current_drink, cooldown_next), where cooldown_next is a boolean indicating whether the next hour is a cooldown.

But how to model this.

Let me think of the transitions:

At hour i, the state is (current_drink, cooldown_next). For the next hour i+1:

If cooldown_next is True, then in hour i+1, you can't take any drink. So the state for i+1 is (current_drink, False), and the energy added is 0.

If cooldown_next is False, then you can choose to take the same drink again, or switch.

If you take the same drink again:

- The new state is (current_drink, False), and the energy added is current_drink's value.

If you switch to the other drink:

- The new state is (other_drink, True), and the energy added is other_drink's value. But then, the next hour (i+1) will be a cooldown.

Wait, but when you switch, the next hour is a cooldown. So, for example:

At hour i, you are on A, cooldown_next is False. You switch to B. Then, the new state is (B, True). So, in hour i+1, you can't take any drink. So the energy for hour i+1 is 0, and the state for i+1 is (B, False) (since the cooldown_next is now False again).

But how to model this.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is (current_drink, cooldown), where cooldown is a boolean indicating whether the current hour is a cooldown.

But then, if the current hour is a cooldown, you can't take any drink, so you have to skip it, and the next hour is not a cooldown.

So, for each hour i:

If the state is (A, False):

- Take A: add A[i], next state is (A, False).

- Switch to B: add B[i], next state is (B, True). But then, in the next hour (i+1), you can't take any drink. So the state for i+1 is (B, True), but you can't take any action. So the energy for i+1 is 0, and the state for i+2 is (B, False).

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to model the transitions step by step.

Let's define the DP as follows:

We have two variables, dpA and dpB, which represent the maximum energy up to the current hour if we are on A or B, respectively, and not in a cooldown.

Additionally, we have two variables, notA and notB, which represent the maximum energy up to the current hour if we are not on A or B (i.e., in a cooldown).

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the DP can track the maximum energy for each possible state.

Let me think of the possible states:

1. Currently on A, and not in cooldown (can take A or B next).

2. Currently on B, and not in cooldown (can take A or B next).

3. Currently in cooldown (can't take any drink, and next hour is not a cooldown).

But how to model this.

Alternatively, the cooldown is a state that applies to the current hour. So, if you are in a cooldown state, you can't take any drink, and the next hour is not a cooldown.

So, for each hour i, the state can be:

- On A, not in cooldown.

- On B, not in cooldown.

- In cooldown.

But how to transition between these states.

Let's model the transitions:

For each hour i:

Case 1: Current state is On A, not in cooldown.

Options:

a) Take A again: add A[i] to the energy. Next state is On A, not in cooldown.

b) Switch to B: add B[i] to the energy. Next state is In cooldown (because after switching, the next hour is a cooldown).

Case 2: Current state is On B, not in cooldown.

Options:

a) Take B again: add B[i] to the energy. Next state is On B, not in cooldown.

b) Switch to A: add A[i] to the energy. Next state is In cooldown.

Case 3: Current state is In cooldown.

Options: can't take any drink. So energy is 0. Next state is not in cooldown. So, the next state can be On A or On B, but since we didn't take any drink, how to model this?

Wait, if you are in cooldown, you can't take any drink. So the next state is not in cooldown, but you have to choose which drink to take. But since you didn't take any drink in the current hour, how does that affect the next state?

This seems complicated. Maybe the cooldown state is only a temporary state that applies to the current hour, and after that, you can choose any drink.

Alternatively, perhaps the cooldown state is a state that applies to the next hour. For example, if you switch in hour i, then in hour i+1, you are in cooldown. So during hour i+1, you can't take any drink, and the next state (i+2) is not in cooldown.

So, the state can be:

- On A, not in cooldown.

- On B, not in cooldown.

- In cooldown (applies to the next hour).

But how to model this.

Alternatively, perhaps the cooldown is a state that applies to the next hour. So, when you switch, you set the next hour to be in cooldown.

Let me try to model this.

We can have two variables, dpA and dpB, which represent the maximum energy up to the current hour if we are on A or B, respectively, and not in cooldown.

Additionally, we have a variable cooldown, which indicates whether the next hour is in cooldown.

But this might not capture all possibilities.

Alternatively, for each hour i, we track two possibilities:

- The maximum energy if we are on A and not in cooldown.

- The maximum energy if we are on B and not in cooldown.

But when we switch, the next hour is in cooldown, so during that hour, we can't take any drink, and the next state is not in cooldown.

So, for example:

At hour i, we are on A, not in cooldown.

We can take A again: energy += A[i], next state is A, not in cooldown.

Or switch to B: energy += B[i], next state is B, and the next hour (i+1) is in cooldown. So during hour i+1, we can't take any drink, and the state for i+1 is B, but in cooldown. Wait, no. Because when you switch to B in hour i, the next hour (i+1) is a cooldown. So during hour i+1, you can't take any drink, and the state for i+2 is B, not in cooldown.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's think of the transitions again.

Let me try to model the DP as follows:

We have two variables, dpA and dpB, which represent the maximum energy up to the current hour if we are on A or B, respectively, and not in cooldown.

For each hour i from 0 to n-1:

- If we are on A (dpA), we can choose to take A again, which adds A[i] to the total. The next state is still on A, not in cooldown.

- Or we can choose to switch to B, which adds B[i] to the total. But then, the next hour (i+1) is a cooldown. So during hour i+1, we can't take any drink, and the state for i+1 is on B, but in cooldown. Wait, but how to model that.

Alternatively, when we switch to B, the next hour is a cooldown. So during that hour, we can't take any drink, and the state after that is on B, not in cooldown.

So, the transition when switching from A to B is:

dpA_prev + B[i] → then, in the next hour, we can't take any drink, so the next state is B, but with a cooldown. So the next hour's state is B, but the cooldown is active. So during that hour, we can't take any drink, and the next state is B, not in cooldown.

But how to model this in the DP.

Alternatively, perhaps the cooldown is a separate state. So, for each hour, we track three possibilities:

- On A, not in cooldown.

- On B, not in cooldown.

- In cooldown.

But this might be manageable.

Let's define three variables:

- a: maximum energy up to current hour if on A and not in cooldown.

- b: maximum energy up to current hour if on B and not in cooldown.

- c: maximum energy up to current hour if in cooldown.

For each hour i, we compute new_a, new_b, new_c based on the previous values.

The transitions would be:

If the current state is a (on A, not in cooldown):

- Take A again: new_a = a + A[i]. The next state is a (on A, not in cooldown).

- Switch to B: new_b = a + B[i]. But then, the next hour (i+1) is in cooldown. So during hour i+1, you can't take any drink, and the state for i+1 is in cooldown. So the new_c would be a + B[i] (since you took B in hour i, and the next hour is cooldown).

Wait, but how does this fit into the transitions.

Alternatively, when you switch to B in hour i, you get B[i] added to your total, and then in hour i+1, you are in cooldown. So the state for i+1 is in cooldown, and the energy for i+1 is 0.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, the cooldown state (c) represents the maximum energy when you are in cooldown. So, during the cooldown hour, you can't take any drink, so the energy is 0, and the next state is not in cooldown.

So, for each hour i:

new_a = max(a + A[i], b_prev + A[i] (if possible?), c_prev + A[i] (if possible?))

Wait, this is getting too vague. Let's think of the transitions step by step.

At each hour i, the possible transitions are:

From state a (on A, not in cooldown):

- Take A again: new_a = a + A[i]. The next state is a (on A, not in cooldown).

- Switch to B: new_b = a + B[i]. The next state is in cooldown (so during hour i+1, you can't take any drink).

From state b (on B, not in cooldown):

- Take B again: new_b = b + B[i]. Next state is b.

- Switch to A: new_a = b + A[i]. Next state is in cooldown.

From state c (in cooldown):

- You can't take any drink. So the energy is 0. The next state is not in cooldown. So, after cooldown, you can choose to take either A or B. But since you didn't take any drink during the cooldown, how to model this.

Wait, perhaps the cooldown state is only for the current hour. So, during the cooldown hour, you can't take any drink, and the next hour is not in cooldown. So, after the cooldown, you can choose any drink.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, the cooldown state is a state that applies to the current hour. So, during the cooldown hour, you can't take any drink, and the next hour is not in cooldown.

So, for example:

If you are in state c (cooldown) at hour i, then during hour i, you can't take any drink. So the energy for hour i is 0. The next state is not in cooldown, and you can choose to take either A or B.

But how to model this in the transitions.

This is getting quite complex. Let's try to model the transitions for each state.

Let's define the three states:

a: on A, not in cooldown.

b: on B, not in cooldown.

c: in cooldown.

For each hour i, the transitions are:

From a:

- Take A: new_a = a + A[i]. Next state is a.

- Switch to B: new_b = a + B[i]. Next state is c (cooldown).

From b:

- Take B: new_b = b + B[i]. Next state is b.

- Switch to A: new_a = b + A[i]. Next state is c.

From c:

- Can't take any drink. So energy is 0. Next state is not in cooldown. So, after this, you can choose to take either A or B. But since you didn't take any drink during the cooldown, how to model this.

Wait, perhaps after the cooldown, you can choose to take either A or B. So, the next state after c is either a or b, but you have to choose the maximum between them.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, when you are in state c (cooldown), during the current hour, you can't take any drink. So the energy for that hour is 0. Then, the next state is not in cooldown, and you can choose to take either A or B. So, the maximum energy after the cooldown would be the maximum of (a_prev, b_prev) + 0 (since you didn't take any drink during the cooldown).

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the cooldown state is only a temporary state that applies to the current hour. So, during the cooldown hour, you can't take any drink, and the next hour is not in cooldown. So, after the cooldown, you can choose to take either A or B.

But how to model this in the transitions.

Let me try to model the transitions for each state:

For each hour i:

new_a = max(
    a_prev + A[i],  # continue taking A
    (c_prev) + A[i]  # after cooldown, take A
)

new_b = max(
    b_prev + B[i],  # continue taking B
    (c_prev) + B[i]  # after cooldown, take B
)

new_c = max(
    a_prev + B[i],  # switch from A to B, next hour is cooldown
    b_prev + A[i]   # switch from B to A, next hour is cooldown
)

Wait, this might be a way to model it.

Let's see:

At each step, the new_c is the maximum of switching from A to B or B to A. Because when you switch, the next hour is a cooldown.

The new_a is the maximum of either continuing to take A (from previous a) or taking A after a cooldown (from previous c).

Similarly for new_b.

But how does the cooldown work here.

For example, if you are in state c_prev (cooldown), then during the current hour i, you can't take any drink. So the energy for hour i is 0. Then, in the next hour (i+1), you can take either A or B. So, the new_a and new_b would be updated based on the previous c_prev.

But in this model, the new_a and new_b are computed as the maximum of their previous values plus the current drink's energy, or the previous c_prev plus the current drink's energy.

But this would imply that after a cooldown, you can take either drink.

But how does the cooldown state transition.

Let me think of an example.

Suppose n=3.

At hour 0:

a_prev is 0 (initial state, not on any drink).

b_prev is 0.

c_prev is 0.

At hour 0:

new_a = max(0 + A[0], 0 + A[0]) = A[0]

new_b = max(0 + B[0], 0 + B[0]) = B[0]

new_c = max(0 + B[0], 0 + A[0]) = max(A[0], B[0])

At hour 1:

a_prev is A[0], b_prev is B[0], c_prev is max(A[0], B[0])

new_a = max(A[0] + A[1], c_prev + A[1])

new_b = max(B[0] + B[1], c_prev + B[1])

new_c = max(A[0] + B[1], B[0] + A[1])

And so on.

But this model seems to allow taking a drink after a cooldown. For example, if you are in c_prev (cooldown), then in the next hour, you can take A or B. But how does the cooldown state transition.

Wait, perhaps the model is that the cooldown state (c_prev) represents the maximum energy up to the previous hour, and during the current hour, you are in cooldown. So, during the current hour, you can't take any drink, and the next state is not in cooldown.

So, the transitions are:

For each hour i:

new_a = max(a_prev + A[i], c_prev + A[i])

new_b = max(b_prev + B[i], c_prev + B[i])

new_c = max(a_prev + B[i], b_prev + A[i])

But this model allows for switching to the other drink, which triggers a cooldown in the next hour.

But how does the cooldown state (c_prev) get updated.

Wait, the new_c is the maximum of switching from A to B or B to A. So, when you switch, you add the current drink's energy, and the next hour is a cooldown.

But in this model, the new_c represents the maximum energy when you switch in the current hour, which triggers a cooldown in the next hour.

But then, during the next hour (i+1), you can't take any drink, so the energy for that hour is 0, and the state for i+1 is not in cooldown.

But according to the model, the new_a and new_b for i+1 would be computed as:

new_a = max(a_prev (from i) + A[i+1], c_prev (from i) + A[i+1])

But c_prev (from i) is the maximum of a_prev (from i-1) + B[i] and b_prev (from i-1) + A[i]. So, this model seems to allow for taking a drink after a cooldown.

But I'm not sure if this model correctly captures the problem's constraints.

Let's test this model with example 2.

Example 2:

A = [4,1,1], B = [1,1,3]

n=3.

Let's compute step by step.

Initialization:

a_prev = 0, b_prev =0, c_prev=0.

Hour 0:

new_a = max(0 +4, 0 +4) =4

new_b = max(0 +1, 0 +1) =1

new_c = max(0 +1, 0 +4) =4

So after hour 0:

a=4, b=1, c=4.

Hour 1:

new_a = max(4 +1, 4 +1) =5

new_b = max(1 +1,4 +1) =5

new_c = max(4 +1, 1 +4) =5

So after hour 1:

a=5, b=5, c=5.

Hour 2:

new_a = max(5 +1,5 +1) =6

new_b = max(5 +3,5 +3) =8

new_c = max(5 +3,5 +1) =8

So the maximum of a and b is 8. But the correct answer is 7.

Wait, this model gives 8, but the correct answer is 7. So this model is incorrect.

Hmm, what's wrong here.

In example 2, the correct path is:

Take A in hour 0 (4), switch to B in hour 1 (so hour 1 is a cooldown), then take B in hour 2 (3). Total is 4 +0 +3=7.

But according to the model, the maximum is 8. So the model is not capturing the cooldown correctly.

Let's see what the model computes for each step.

At hour 0:

a=4, b=1, c=4.

At hour 1:

new_a is max(4+1,4+1) =5.

new_b is max(1+1,4+1) =5.

new_c is max(4+1,1+4) =5.

So after hour 1, a=5, b=5, c=5.

At hour 2:

new_a is max(5+1,5+1) =6.

new_b is max(5+3,5+3) =8.

new_c is max(5+3,5+1) =8.

So the maximum is 8, which is higher than the correct answer. So the model is incorrect.

But why?

Because the model allows taking B in hour 1 and B in hour 2, which would give 1+3=4, but according to the model, it's 5+3=8. How is that possible?

Wait, the model's new_b for hour 1 is 5. How is that possible?

At hour 1, new_b is max(1+1,4+1) =5. So the 4+1 comes from c_prev (which is 4) + B[1] (1). So this represents taking B after a cooldown.

But how did the cooldown happen?

The c_prev for hour 0 is 4, which is the maximum of a_prev (0) + B[0] (1) and b_prev (0) + A[0] (4). So c_prev is 4, which represents switching from A to B in hour 0, which triggers a cooldown in hour 1.

So during hour 1, you can't take any drink. So the energy for hour 1 is 0. Then, in hour 2, you can take B.

But according to the model, new_b for hour 1 is 5, which is 4 (c_prev) +1 (B[1]) =5. But this would imply that in hour 1, you took B, but according to the problem's rules, if you switch in hour 0, then hour 1 is a cooldown, so you can't take any drink. So the model is allowing taking B in hour 1 even after a cooldown, which is incorrect.

Ah, here's the problem. The model allows taking a drink during the cooldown hour, which is not allowed.

So the model is incorrect because it allows taking a drink during the cooldown hour.

So the model's transitions are not correctly handling the cooldown.

So, the mistake is that when you are in a cooldown state (c_prev), you can't take any drink in the current hour. So the model's new_a and new_b should not be updated based on c_prev, because during the cooldown hour, you can't take any drink.

So, the correct transitions should be:

new_a = max(a_prev + A[i], ... )

But when you are in a cooldown state (c_prev), you can't take any drink in the current hour. So the new_a and new_b should not be updated based on c_prev.

Wait, this is a key insight. The cooldown state (c_prev) represents the maximum energy up to the previous hour, and during the current hour, you can't take any drink. So, during the current hour, you can't take any drink, so the new_a and new_b should not be updated based on c_prev. Instead, the new_a and new_b can only be updated based on the previous a_prev and b_prev.

But how to model this.

Let me re-express the transitions:

For each hour i:

new_a = max(a_prev + A[i], ... )

But if you are in a cooldown state (c_prev), you can't take any drink in the current hour. So the new_a and new_b can only be updated based on the previous a_prev and b_prev.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's think again.

The cooldown state (c_prev) represents the maximum energy up to the previous hour, and during the current hour, you are in cooldown. So during the current hour, you can't take any drink. So the energy for the current hour is 0, and the next state is not in cooldown.

So, the transitions should be:

For each hour i:

new_a = max(a_prev + A[i], ... )

But if you are in a cooldown state (c_prev), you can't take any drink in the current hour. So the new_a and new_b can't be updated based on c_prev.

Wait, perhaps the correct way to model this is:

The new_a and new_b can only be updated based on the previous a_prev and b_prev, because during the current hour, if you are in a cooldown state, you can't take any drink. So the only way to take a drink in the current hour is if you were not in a cooldown state in the previous hour.

So, the transitions would be:

new_a = max(a_prev + A[i], ... )

But if you were in a cooldown state in the previous hour (c_prev), you can't take any drink in the current hour. So the new_a and new_b can't be updated based on c_prev.

So, the correct transitions are:

new_a = max(a_prev + A[i], ... )

new_b = max(b_prev + B[i], ... )

new_c = max(a_prev + B[i], b_prev + A[i])

But how to model the cooldown.

Wait, perhaps the cooldown state (c_prev) represents the maximum energy up to the previous hour, and during the current hour, you can't take any drink. So, the new_a and new_b for the current hour can only be updated based on the previous a_prev and b_prev, not c_prev.

So, the transitions would be:

new_a = max(a_prev + A[i], ... )

new_b = max(b_prev + B[i], ... )

new_c = max(a_prev + B[i], b_prev + A[i])

But then, how does the cooldown state get updated.

For example, when you switch from A to B, you add B[i] to the total, and the next hour is a cooldown.

So, new_c is the maximum of a_prev + B[i] and b_prev + A[i], which represents switching in the current hour, which triggers a cooldown in the next hour.

But during the next hour, you can't take any drink, so the new_a and new_b for the next hour are computed based on the previous a_prev and b_prev (from the current hour's a and b).

So, let's re-model the transitions:

For each hour i:

new_a = max(a_prev + A[i], ... )

new_b = max(b_prev + B[i], ... )

new_c = max(a_prev + B[i], b_prev + A[i])

But what about the case where you are in a cooldown state in the previous hour (c_prev). How does that affect the current hour's a and b.

Ah, perhaps the cooldown state (c_prev) represents the maximum energy up to the previous hour, and during the current hour, you can't take any drink. So, the new_a and new_b for the current hour can only be updated based on the previous a_prev and b_prev, not c_prev.

So, the transitions are:

new_a = max(a_prev + A[i], ... )

new_b = max(b_prev + B[i], ... )

new_c = max(a_prev + B[i], b_prev + A[i])

But then, the new_a and new_b are computed based on the previous a_prev and b_prev, not considering the cooldown.

But this would allow taking a drink even if you were in a cooldown state in the previous hour.

Wait, no. Because if you were in a cooldown state in the previous hour (c_prev), then during the current hour, you can't take any drink. So the new_a and new_b for the current hour can't be updated based on c_prev. So, the new_a and new_b can only be updated based on the previous a_prev and b_prev.

So, the correct transitions are:

new_a = max(a_prev + A[i], ... )

new_b = max(b_prev + B[i], ... )

new_c = max(a_prev + B[i], b_prev + A[i])

But then, how does the cooldown state get updated.

Let's test this model with example 2.

Example 2:

A = [4,1,1], B = [1,1,3]

n=3.

Initialization:

a_prev =0, b_prev=0, c_prev=0.

Hour 0:

new_a = max(0 +4) =4 (since there's no other option)

new_b = max(0 +1) =1

new_c = max(0 +1, 0 +4) =4

So after hour 0:

a=4, b=1, c=4.

Hour 1:

new_a = max(4 +1) =5

new_b = max(1 +1) =2

new_c = max(4 +1, 1 +4) =5

So after hour 1:

a=5, b=2, c=5.

Hour 2:

new_a = max(5 +1) =6

new_b = max(2 +3) =5

new_c = max(5 +3, 2 +1) =8

So the maximum of a and b is 6, which is still not correct. The correct answer is 7.

Hmm, this model is still not working.

What's the problem here?

In the correct scenario, after taking A in hour 0, switching to B in hour 1 (which triggers a cooldown in hour 2), then taking B in hour 3 (but n=3, so hours are 0,1,2).

Wait, the example has n=3, so hours are 0,1,2.

The correct path is:

Hour 0: take A (4).

Hour 1: switch to B (so cooldown in hour 2).

Hour 2: can't take any drink (cooldown), so energy is 0.

But according to the model, after hour 0, a=4, b=1, c=4.

In hour 1:

new_c is max(4 +1, 1 +4) =5. So new_c is 5.

But this represents switching from A to B in hour 1, which triggers a cooldown in hour 2.

So during hour 2, you can't take any drink. So the energy for hour 2 is 0.

But according to the model, new_a and new_b for hour 2 are computed as:

new_a = max(5 +1, ... ) =6.

new_b = max(2 +3, ... ) =5.

But how is this possible?

Because in hour 1, the new_c is 5, which represents switching from A to B in hour 1. So during hour 2, you can't take any drink. So the new_a and new_b for hour 2 should be computed based on the previous a_prev and b_prev (from hour 1), which are 5 and 2.

But according to the model, new_a is 5+1=6, which implies taking A in hour 2. But according to the problem's rules, if you switched in hour 1, then hour 2 is a cooldown, so you can't take any drink. So the model is allowing taking A in hour 2 even after a cooldown.

This is the mistake. The model is not correctly handling the cooldown.

So, the problem is that when you switch in hour i, the next hour (i+1) is a cooldown. So during hour i+1, you can't take any drink. So the new_a and new_b for hour i+1 should not be updated based on the previous a_prev and b_prev, but rather, they should be set to zero, and the next state is not in cooldown.

But how to model this.

Alternative approach: track the state as (current_drink, cooldown_next), where cooldown_next is a boolean indicating whether the next hour is a cooldown.

So, for each hour i, we have four possible states:

- (A, False): currently on A, next hour is not a cooldown.

- (A, True): currently on A, next hour is a cooldown.

- (B, False): currently on B, next hour is not a cooldown.

- (B, True): currently on B, next hour is a cooldown.

But this might be manageable.

Let's model this with four variables:

dpAFalse: maximum energy if currently on A and next hour is not a cooldown.

dpAFALSE: maximum energy if currently on A and next hour is a cooldown.

Similarly for B.

Wait, perhaps it's better to track two variables for each drink: whether the next hour is a cooldown.

So, for each hour i, we track:

- a_next: the maximum energy if we are on A and the next hour is not a cooldown.

- a_cooldown: the maximum energy if we are on A and the next hour is a cooldown.

Similarly for B.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to model it.

At each hour i, the state is:

- On A, next hour is not a cooldown.

- On A, next hour is a cooldown.

- On B, next hour is not a cooldown.

- On B, next hour is a cooldown.

For each of these states, we track the maximum energy.

The transitions would be:

For each hour i:

If the current state is (A, not cooldown):

- Take A again: add A[i], next state is (A, not cooldown).

- Switch to B: add B[i], next state is (B, cooldown).

If the current state is (A, cooldown):

- Can't take any drink. So energy is 0. Next state is (A, not cooldown).

If the current state is (B, not cooldown):

- Take B again: add B[i], next state is (B, not cooldown).

- Switch to A: add A[i], next state is (A, cooldown).

If the current state is (B, cooldown):

- Can't take any drink. Energy is 0. Next state is (B, not cooldown).

So, for each state, we can compute the next state's values.

Let's model this with four variables: a_not_cooldown, a_cooldown, b_not_cooldown, b_cooldown.

Initialization:

At hour 0, we can start with either A or B, and the next hour is not a cooldown.

So, for hour 0:

a_not_cooldown = A[0] (if we start with A and next hour is not a cooldown).

a_cooldown = 0 (if we start with A and next hour is a cooldown, but this is not possible at hour 0).

Similarly for B.

Wait, but the initial state is that we can start with either A or B, and the next hour is not a cooldown.

So, for hour 0:

a_not_cooldown = A[0]

b_not_cooldown = B[0]

a_cooldown = 0 (not possible)

b_cooldown = 0 (not possible)

But this is only for the first hour. For subsequent hours, the states can be in any of the four possibilities.

Let's try to model this.

For each hour i from 0 to n-1:

Compute the new values based on the previous values.

At each step:

new_a_not_cooldown = max(
    a_not_cooldown + A[i],  # continue on A, next hour not cooldown
    b_cooldown + A[i]       # after cooldown, take A
)

new_a_cooldown = a_not_cooldown + B[i]  # switch to B, next hour is cooldown

new_b_not_cooldown = max(
    b_not_cooldown + B[i],  # continue on B, next hour not cooldown
    a_cooldown + B[i]       # after cooldown, take B
)

new_b_cooldown = b_not_cooldown + A[i]  # switch to A, next hour is cooldown

But wait, this is for the transitions.

Let's see:

For new_a_not_cooldown:

It can be reached by:

- Being on A and not in cooldown, taking A again. So previous state is a_not_cooldown, add A[i], next state is a_not_cooldown.

- Being in a cooldown state (b_cooldown) and taking A. But how?

Wait, perhaps the new_a_not_cooldown is the maximum of:

- a_not_cooldown (previous state) + A[i] (taking A again, next state is not cooldown).

- b_cooldown (previous state) + A[i] (taking A after cooldown, next state is not cooldown).

Similarly for new_b_not_cooldown.

The new_a_cooldown is the maximum of:

- a_not_cooldown (previous state) + B[i] (switching to B, next state is cooldown).

Similarly, new_b_cooldown is the maximum of:

- b_not_cooldown (previous state) + A[i] (switching to A, next state is cooldown).

But this model may not capture all possibilities.

Let's test this model with example 2.

Example 2:

A = [4,1,1], B = [1,1,3]

n=3.

Initialization:

At hour 0:

a_not_cooldown =4 (start with A, next hour not cooldown)

b_not_cooldown =1 (start with B, next hour not cooldown)

a_cooldown =0

b_cooldown =0

Hour 0:

new_a_not_cooldown = max(4+4, 0+4) =8? No, wait, the indices are 0-based. So for hour 0, i=0.

Wait, the code would process each hour from 0 to n-1.

So for hour 0:

new_a_not_cooldown = max(a_not_cooldown_prev + A[0], b_cooldown_prev + A[0])

But a_not_cooldown_prev is 4 (from initialization), A[0] is4. So 4+4=8.

But this is not correct. Because in hour 0, you can't take A again if you started with A. Wait, no. The initial state is that you start with A or B. So for hour 0, you take A or B, and the next hour is not a cooldown.

So for hour 0, the initial a_not_cooldown is A[0], and b_not_cooldown is B[0].

But in the model, for hour 0, the new_a_not_cooldown is computed as max(a_not_cooldown_prev + A[0], ... ), but a_not_cooldown_prev is already A[0]. So this would be A[0] + A[0], which is incorrect.

Ah, here's the mistake. The model is processing each hour as follows:

For each hour i, the variables represent the state after processing hour i-1. So, for hour 0, the initial variables are the state before processing hour 0.

So, the initial variables are:

a_not_cooldown =0 (before processing hour 0, you can start with A or B, but the initial state is not in any cooldown).

Wait, this is getting very confusing. Perhaps the model needs to be reinitialized properly.

Let me re-express the model.

We need to track the state after each hour. For each hour i, the state is:

- On A, next hour is not a cooldown.

- On A, next hour is a cooldown.

- On B, next hour is not a cooldown.

- On B, next hour is a cooldown.

At each hour i, we compute the new state based on the previous state.

For example, if the previous state is (A, not cooldown), then during hour i, you can take A again, leading to (A, not cooldown) for the next hour, or switch to B, leading to (B, cooldown) for the next hour.

If the previous state is (A, cooldown), then during hour i, you can't take any drink. So the next state is (A, not cooldown), and the energy is 0.

Similarly for the other states.

So, the transitions are:

For each hour i:

new_a_not_cooldown = max(
    (previous a_not_cooldown) + A[i],  # take A again
    (previous b_cooldown) + A[i]        # after cooldown, take A
)

new_a_cooldown = (previous a_not_cooldown) + B[i]  # switch to B

new_b_not_cooldown = max(
    (previous b_not_cooldown) + B[i],  # take B again
    (previous a_cooldown) + B[i]        # after cooldown, take B
)

new_b_cooldown = (previous b_not_cooldown) + A[i]  # switch to A

But this model may not capture all possibilities.

Let's test this model with example 2.

Example 2:

A = [4,1,1], B = [1,1,3]

n=3.

Initialization:

At the beginning (before any hours), the possible states are:

- You can start with A, next hour is not a cooldown. So a_not_cooldown = A[0] =4.

- You can start with B, next hour is not a cooldown. So b_not_cooldown = B[0] =1.

The other states (a_cooldown and b_cooldown) are 0.

So, initial variables:

a_not_cooldown =4

a_cooldown =0

b_not_cooldown =1

b_cooldown =0

Now, process hour 0 (i=0):

new_a_not_cooldown = max(4 +4, 0 +4) =8

new_a_cooldown =4 +1 =5

new_b_not_cooldown = max(1 +1, 0 +1) =2

new_b_cooldown =1 +4 =5

So after hour 0:

a_not_cooldown =8

a_cooldown =5

b_not_cooldown =2

b_cooldown =5

But this is for hour 0. But the correct answer for hour 0 is to take A or B once. So this model is not correct.

Ah, I see the problem. The model is adding the current hour's drink to the previous state, which is not correct. Because the previous state represents the state before processing the current hour.

So, for example, the initial a_not_cooldown is 4, which is the energy after taking A in hour 0. Then, when processing hour 0, we are adding A[0] again, which is incorrect.

This suggests that the model is not correctly initialized.

The correct approach is to initialize the variables for the first hour (i=0) as follows:

At the start (before any hours), you can choose to start with A or B. So:

a_not_cooldown_prev = 0 (you haven't taken any drink yet)

b_not_cooldown_prev =0

a_cooldown_prev = -infinity (not possible)

b_cooldown_prev = -infinity (not possible)

Then, for hour 0:

new_a_not_cooldown = max(a_not_cooldown_prev + A[0], b_cooldown_prev + A[0]) = max(0+4, -inf) =4

new_a_cooldown = a_not_cooldown_prev + B[0] =0+1=1

new_b_not_cooldown = max(b_not_cooldown_prev + B[0], a_cooldown_prev + B[0]) = max(0+1, -inf) =1

new_b_cooldown = b_not_cooldown_prev + A[0] =0+4=4

So after hour 0:

a_not_cooldown =4

a_cooldown =1

b_not_cooldown =1

b_cooldown =4

Now, process hour 1 (i=1):

new_a_not_cooldown = max(4 +1, 4 +1) =5

new_a_cooldown =4 +1=5

new_b_not_cooldown = max(1 +1, 1 +1) =2

new_b_cooldown =1 +4=5

So after hour 1:

a_not_cooldown =5

a_cooldown =5

b_not_cooldown =2

b_cooldown =5

Process hour 2 (i=2):

new_a_not_cooldown = max(5 +1,5 +1) =6

new_a_cooldown =5 +3=8

new_b_not_cooldown = max(2 +3,5 +3) =8

new_b_cooldown =2 +1=3

So after hour 2:

a_not_cooldown =6

a_cooldown =8

b_not_cooldown =8

b_cooldown =3

The maximum of a_not_cooldown, a_cooldown, b_not_cooldown, b_cooldown is 8. But the correct answer is 7.

So this model is still not working.

But according to the model, the maximum is 8, which is higher than the correct answer. So there's a flaw in the model.

What's the correct path according to the model?

The model's maximum is 8, which comes from b_not_cooldown=8. How is this possible?

b_not_cooldown=8 is computed as max(2+3,5+3) =8. So this represents taking B in hour 2 after being in a cooldown.

But how did that happen.

The previous state for hour 1 is b_not_cooldown=2 and a_cooldown=5.

So, for hour 2, new_b_not_cooldown is max(2+3,5+3) =8.

The 5+3 comes from a_cooldown_prev=5 (which is the a_cooldown from hour 1) + B[2] (3).

But a_cooldown from hour 1 is 5, which represents switching from A to B in hour 1. So during hour 1, you switched to B, which triggers a cooldown in hour 2. So during hour 2, you can't take any drink. But according to the model, you can take B in hour 2 after a cooldown.

This is the mistake. The model allows taking a drink during the cooldown hour, which is not allowed.

So, the model is incorrect because it allows taking a drink during the cooldown hour.

The correct approach is that during the cooldown hour, you can't take any drink. So, the new_a_not_cooldown and new_b_not_cooldown should not be updated based on the previous a_cooldown and b_cooldown.

So, the correct transitions should be:

new_a_not_cooldown = max(a_not_cooldown_prev + A[i], ... )

new_b_not_cooldown = max(b_not_cooldown_prev + B[i], ... )

But the ... part should not include the previous a_cooldown and b_cooldown.

So, the correct transitions are:

new_a_not_cooldown = max(a_not_cooldown_prev + A[i], ... )

new_a_cooldown = a_not_cooldown_prev + B[i]

new_b_not_cooldown = max(b_not_cooldown_prev + B[i], ... )

new_b_cooldown = b_not_cooldown_prev + A[i]

But this would mean that the only way to take a drink after a cooldown is if you were in a cooldown state in the previous hour.

But this is not possible, because during the cooldown hour, you can't take any drink.

So, the correct model is:

new_a_not_cooldown = a_not_cooldown_prev + A[i]

new_a_cooldown = a_not_cooldown_prev + B[i]

new_b_not_cooldown = b_not_cooldown_prev + B[i]

new_b_cooldown = b_not_cooldown_prev + A[i]

But this model doesn't allow taking a drink after a cooldown.

But this would not allow the correct path in example 2.

In example 2, the correct path is:

Take A in hour 0 (4), switch to B in hour 1 (cooldown in hour 2), then can't take anything in hour 2.

But according to this model, the maximum would be:

After hour 0:

a_not_cooldown =4

a_cooldown =0 +1=1

b_not_cooldown =1

b_cooldown =0 +4=4

After hour 1:

a_not_cooldown =4 +1=5

a_cooldown =4 +1=5

b_not_cooldown =1 +1=2

b_cooldown =1 +4=5

After hour 2:

a_not_cooldown =5 +1=6

a_cooldown =5 +3=8

b_not_cooldown =2 +3=5

b_cooldown =2 +1=3

The maximum is 8, which is still incorrect.

But according to the problem's example, the correct answer is 7.

So, this model is not working.

Hmm, this is getting very complicated. Perhaps I need to find a different approach.

Alternative approach: since the cooldown is only one hour after switching, perhaps we can model the problem with dynamic programming where we track the last drink taken and whether we are in a cooldown.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to use dynamic programming with two states: the last drink taken and whether we are in a cooldown.

But given the time, perhaps the correct solution is to use dynamic programming with two variables for each drink, tracking the maximum energy up to the current hour if we are on that drink and not in a cooldown, and another variable for the maximum energy if we are in a cooldown.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct solution is to track two variables: the maximum energy if we end the current hour on A or B, and whether we are in a cooldown.

But given the time, perhaps the correct solution is to use dynamic programming with two variables for each drink, and track the maximum energy up to the current hour.

Let me think of the following approach:

We can track two variables, prevA and prevB, which represent the maximum energy up to the previous hour if we ended on A or B.

For each hour i, we compute the new values for currA and currB.

currA can be the maximum of:

- prevA + A[i] (continue on A)

- prevB + A[i] (switch from B to A, but this requires that the previous hour was B and we are not in a cooldown. But how to model this.

Alternatively, when you switch from B to A, you have to wait for one hour. So, the energy for the current hour is A[i], but the next hour is a cooldown.

But this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the maximum energy for ending on A at hour i is the maximum between:

- ending on A at hour i-1 and taking A again.

- ending on B at hour i-1 and switching to A, which requires that the previous hour was B and we are not in a cooldown.

But how to model the cooldown.

Perhaps the correct approach is to track two variables for each drink: the maximum energy up to hour i if we are on that drink and not in a cooldown, and the maximum energy up to hour i if we are on that drink and in a cooldown.

But this is getting too complex.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct solution is to use dynamic programming with two variables for each drink, and track the maximum energy up to the current hour.

The code would look something like this:

Initialize prevA and prevB to 0.

For each i in 0 to n-1:

currA = max(prevA + A[i], prevB + A[i])

currB = max(prevB + B[i], prevA + B[i])

prevA, prevB = currA, currB

But this is the same as the initial model, which gives the wrong answer for example 2.

But according to this model, example 2 would give:

Hour 0:

prevA=4, prevB=1.

Hour 1:

currA = max(4+1, 1+1) =5.

currB = max(1+1,4+1) =5.

Hour 2:

currA = max(5+1,5+1) =6.

currB = max(5+3,5+1) =8.

So the maximum is 8, which is incorrect.

But the correct answer is 7.

So this model is incorrect.

The problem is that this model allows switching between drinks without considering the cooldown.

So, the correct approach must account for the cooldown when switching.

Another idea: when you switch from A to B, you have to skip the next hour. So, the maximum energy for switching from A to B at hour i is A[i] + B[i+2], but this is only possible if i+2 < n.

But this approach would require looking ahead, which is not feasible for large n.

Alternatively, we can model the problem with dynamic programming, where the state is the last drink taken and whether we are in a cooldown.

But given the time, perhaps the correct solution is to use dynamic programming with two variables for each drink, and track the maximum energy up to the current hour, considering the cooldown.

After some research, I recall that this problem is similar to the "maximum sum with cooldown" problem, which can be solved with dynamic programming.

In the "maximum sum with cooldown" problem, you can't have two adjacent elements. The solution uses three variables: take, skip, and
