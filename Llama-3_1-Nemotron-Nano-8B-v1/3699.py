To solve this problem, we need to count the number of special subsequences in an array. A special subsequence is defined as a subsequence of length 4, represented by indices (p, q, r, s) where p < q < r < s, with the conditions that nums[p] * nums[r] == nums[q] * nums[s] and there is at least one element between each pair of indices.

### Approach
1. **Generate Valid Pairs**: First, generate all valid pairs (i, j) where the distance between i and j is at least 2 (i.e., j - i >= 2). These pairs are stored in a dictionary grouped by their product value.
2. **Group by Product**: For each product value, collect all valid pairs (i, j) and sort them by the second index (j).
3. **Count Valid Quadruples**: For each product group,
