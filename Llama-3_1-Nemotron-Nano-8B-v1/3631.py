Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of positive integers less than n (given as a binary string) that are k-reducible. Let's understand the problem again.

A number x is k-reducible if, after performing the operation of replacing x with the count of set bits (the number of 1s in binary) at most k times, it reduces to 1. So, for example, if x is 6 (110), the first operation gives 2 (10), then the next gives 1. So with k=1, it's allowed because after one operation, it's 2, but wait, wait. Wait, the problem says "at most k times". Wait, the example 1 says that 6 is not in the list because after one operation, it's 2, which is not 1. So the process must reach 1 in exactly k steps? Or within k steps?

Wait, the example 1's explanation says that the 1-reducible numbers are 1, 2, 4. Let's see:

For 1: it's already 1. So the number of steps is 0, which is <=k=1. So it's included.

For 2 (10), the count is 1. So after one step, it becomes 1. So that's allowed.

For 4 (100), the count is 1. So after one step, it's 1. So allowed.

But 3 (11) has two set bits. So first step reduces to 2, then next step to 1. So for k=1, that's two steps, which is more than k. So 3 is not included.

So the condition is that the number of steps required to reach 1 is <=k. So for each x, we need to compute the number of steps it takes to reach 1 when repeatedly replacing x with the count of set bits. If that number of steps is <=k, then x is k-reducible.

So the problem is to count all x < n where the steps to reach 1 is <=k.

Now, the challenge is to compute this efficiently given that n can be up to 2^800, which is way too big to handle directly. So we need a dynamic programming approach that can process the binary string digit by digit, keeping track of certain states.

First, let's think about how to compute the steps for a number x. Let's call the function f(x) that returns the number of steps required to reduce x to 1. For example:

f(1) = 0 (since it's already 1)
f(2) = 1 (1 step)
f(3) = 2 (3 → 2 → 1)
f(4) = 1 (4 → 1)
f(5) = 2 (5 → 2 → 1)
f(6) = 2 (6 → 2 → 1)
f(7) = 2 (7 → 3 → 2 → 1? Wait, wait. Wait, 7 is 111. The count is 3. Then next step is count of 3's bits (2), then count of 2's bits (1). So steps are 3. So for k=1, 7 is not included. But in example 1, the input is s="111" (n=7), and k=1. The output is 3, which includes 1,2,4. So 7 is not counted because it's not less than n. So for x=7, steps are 3, which is more than k=1. So it's excluded.

So the function f(x) is the number of steps to reach 1. So for x to be k-reducible, f(x) <=k.

The problem is to compute the count of x < n where f(x) <=k.

But n can be up to 2^800, which is way too big to process each x individually. So we need a way to model this with dynamic programming, considering the binary digits of n and tracking the possible states.

Let's think about the steps for a number. The steps depend on the number of set bits in each iteration. Let's model the steps required for a number x as follows:

For x, the steps are:

steps(x) = 1 + steps(count_set_bits(x)), if x != 1 and count_set_bits(x) != 1.

If x is 1, steps is 0.

If count_set_bits(x) is 1, then steps is 1.

Wait, for example, x=4 (100), count is 1. So steps is 1. So steps(4) =1.

x=3 (11), count is 2. steps(3) = 1 + steps(2). steps(2) is 1. So steps(3) is 2.

So the steps can be computed recursively, but for large x, this is not feasible. So we need to precompute steps for all possible x that can be encountered during the reduction process.

But what's the maximum possible value of x that we need to consider? Let's see. The original x is less than n, which is up to 2^800. But when we compute the count of set bits, the maximum possible count is the number of bits of x. For example, if x is 800 bits long, the maximum count is 800. Then, the next step would be the count of set bits of 800, which is 1 (since 800 in binary is 1100100000, which has 3 set bits. Wait, 800 is 512 + 256 + 32 = 800. So 3 set bits. So steps(800) would be 1 + steps(3). steps(3) is 2. So steps(800) is 3.

But even for x up to 2^800, the steps can't be more than, say, log*(x) (iterated logarithm). But since k is up to 5, perhaps the steps we need to track are up to 5. So for any x, if steps(x) >k, we can ignore it.

So the approach is to model the problem with dynamic programming, where for each position in the binary string, we track the number of set bits so far, the current steps taken, and whether the number being formed is already less than the prefix of n up to that position. Additionally, we need to track the steps required to reach 1 from the current count of set bits.

Wait, but how can we model the steps required for the current count of set bits? Because once we have the count of set bits, the steps required depend on that count. So perhaps we can precompute for all possible counts (up to the maximum possible count, which is the length of the binary string) the steps required to reach 1.

Yes. Let's precompute a memoization table for steps required for numbers up to a certain size. For example, for any number m, steps[m] is the number of steps required to reduce m to 1. Then, for a given count of set bits c, the steps required would be steps[c]. So during the DP, when we have a certain count of set bits, we can look up steps[c] and see if the total steps (current steps + steps[c]) is <=k.

Wait, but the steps are cumulative. For example, when we form a number x with a certain count of set bits c, then the steps required for x is 1 + steps[c], unless c is 1 (then steps is 0 if x is 1, but x is already 1). Wait, no. Let's think again.

Wait, the steps for x is the number of operations needed to reduce x to 1. Each operation replaces x with the count of its set bits. So for x, steps(x) is 0 if x is 1. Otherwise, steps(x) is 1 + steps(count_set_bits(x)).

So for example, steps(3) is 1 + steps(2) = 1 + 1 + steps(1) = 2.

So for any x, steps(x) can be computed recursively. But for x up to 2^800, this is not feasible. However, when we process the binary string, the count of set bits can be up to the length of the binary string (since each bit can be 1). For example, if the binary string is 800 bits long, the maximum count is 800. Then, steps(800) is 1 + steps(3) (since 800 in binary is 1100100000, which has 3 set bits). Then steps(3) is 2. So steps(800) is 3.

But even for numbers up to 800, steps can be computed recursively. So perhaps we can precompute steps for all possible counts of set bits up to the maximum possible (which is the length of the binary string, say L). Then, during the DP, when we have a count of set bits c, we can check if the steps required (steps[c]) plus the steps taken so far is <=k.

Wait, but the steps taken so far would be the number of steps added by the current number. For example, when we form a number x with c set bits, then the steps for x is 1 + steps[c], unless x is 1 (steps 0). So during the DP, for each possible count of set bits, and for each possible number of steps taken so far, we can track whether the total steps (current steps + steps[c]) is <=k.

But how do we model this in the DP?

Alternatively, for each position in the binary string, we can track:

- The number of set bits so far (c)
- The number of steps taken so far (s)
- Whether the current prefix is already less than the prefix of n (tight)
- The current value of the number (but since it's binary, perhaps we can track the count of set bits and the current position, and whether it's tight)

But the problem is that the steps required for the current number depend on the count of set bits. So for a given count of set bits c, the steps required is steps[c]. So when we form a number x with c set bits, the steps required is steps[c] + s (where s is the steps taken so far). Wait, no. Because the steps taken so far would be the steps added by the previous numbers. Wait, no. Let's think: when we form a number x, the steps to reduce x to 1 is steps[x] = 1 + steps[count_set_bits(x)]. So for example, if x is 3 (11), steps is 1 + steps[2] = 1 + 1 = 2. So the steps for x is 1 plus the steps for the count of set bits of x.

But in the DP, when building the number x digit by digit, the count of set bits is known. So for each possible count of set bits c, and for each possible steps taken so far (s), we can compute the total steps as s + steps[c]. But how?

Wait, perhaps the steps taken so far (s) is the number of steps that have been accumulated up to this point. For example, when building the number x, each time we add a bit, the count of set bits increases by 1 if the bit is 1. Then, when the number is complete, the steps required is steps[x] = 1 + steps[count_set_bits(x)]. But steps[count_set_bits(x)] is precomputed.

But how do we track the steps during the DP? Because the steps for x depend on the count of set bits, which is only known when the entire number is built. So perhaps the steps can't be tracked during the DP until the number is complete. But that's a problem because the number can be up to 800 bits long, and we can't process each possible x.

Alternative approach: For each possible count of set bits c, precompute the steps required to reduce c to 1. Then, for a number x with c set bits, the steps required is 1 + steps[c], unless x is 1 (steps 0). But x is 1 only if c is 1 and the number is 1. So for numbers other than 1, the steps are 1 + steps[c].

Wait, but for x=2 (10), the count is 1, so steps is 1 + steps[1] = 1 + 0 = 1. Which is correct.

For x=3 (11), count is 2, steps is 1 + steps[2] = 1 +1=2.

So the steps for x is 1 + steps[count_set_bits(x)].

So, the steps for x can be computed once we know the count of set bits. So during the DP, when building the number, we can track the count of set bits (c) and the number of steps taken so far (s). But how?

Wait, the steps taken so far (s) would be the number of steps that have been added by the previous reductions. For example, when building the number x, each time we add a bit, the count of set bits increases. But the steps for x is 1 + steps[c], where c is the count of set bits. So the total steps for x is 1 (for the current step) plus the steps required for c.

But the steps required for c is steps[c], which is precomputed. So for the entire number x, the steps required is 1 + steps[c], unless x is 1 (steps 0). So during the DP, when the number is built, we can compute the steps as 1 + steps[c], and check if that is <=k.

But how do we track this during the DP? Because the steps for x depend on the count of set bits, which is only known when the entire number is built.

So the idea is:

- Precompute steps for all possible c (count of set bits) up to the maximum possible (which is the length of the binary string, L). For example, if the binary string is 800 bits long, the maximum c is 800.

- Then, during the DP, for each possible count of set bits c, and for each possible position in the binary string, track the number of set bits so far, and whether the current prefix is tight (i.e., equal to the prefix of n up to this position). Also, track the number of steps taken so far (s). But wait, the steps taken so far would be the steps added by the previous numbers. But in this problem, each number is processed once. So for each x, the steps required is 1 + steps[c], where c is the count of set bits of x. So the total steps for x is 1 + steps[c]. So for x to be k-reducible, 1 + steps[c] <=k. Unless x is 1, which has steps 0.

So the problem reduces to counting all x <n where either x is 1 (steps 0) or 1 + steps[c] <=k, where c is the count of set bits of x.

Wait, but for x=1, steps is 0. So if k >=0, x=1 is included. But in the problem statement, the example 3 has s="1" (n=1), so the answer is 0. So numbers less than n (which is 1) are 0, but the problem says positive integers, so no numbers. So the answer is 0.

So the approach is:

For each x in 1..n-1:

if x is 1: steps is 0. So if k >=0, it's included.

else: steps is 1 + steps[c], where c is the count of set bits of x. So if 1 + steps[c] <=k, then x is k-reducible.

So the problem is to count all x <n where either x is 1 and k >=0, or x is not 1 and 1 + steps[c] <=k.

But how to compute this efficiently for very large n (up to 2^800)?

The key is to model the count of numbers x <n with a certain count of set bits c, and then for each c, check if 1 + steps[c] <=k. Then sum all such counts.

But how to compute the count of numbers x <n with exactly m set bits, for each m where 1 + steps[m] <=k.

Wait, but that's not exactly correct. Because for x=1, the count of set bits is 1, but steps is 0. So for x=1, steps is 0, which is <=k for any k>=0. So x=1 is included if k >=0.

For other x, steps is 1 + steps[c], where c is the count of set bits. So for x to be k-reducible, 1 + steps[c] <=k.

So the problem can be broken down into:

count = 0

if 1 <n (i.e., n>1), then add 1 to the count (since x=1 is included if k >=0, which it is since k>=1 in the examples, but the problem says k can be 1 to 5. So for k=0, but the constraints say 1<=k<=5. So in the problem, k is at least 1. So x=1 is always included if n>1.

Then, for all x >=2, x <n, count the numbers where 1 + steps[c] <=k, where c is the count of set bits of x.

So the problem reduces to:

count = (1 if n>1 else 0) + sum_{x=2}^{n-1} [1 + steps[count_set_bits(x)] <=k]

But how to compute this sum efficiently.

The key is to compute for each possible c (count of set bits), the number of numbers x <n with exactly c set bits, and then for each c where 1 + steps[c] <=k, add that count to the total.

But wait, for x=1, c=1, but steps is 0. So for x=1, it's a special case. So the count for c=1 is (number of x <n with c=1) minus 1 (since x=1 is handled separately) plus 1 if x=1 is included.

But perhaps it's easier to handle x=1 as a separate case and then compute the sum for x >=2.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute steps[m] for all m up to the maximum possible count of set bits (which is the length of the binary string s).

2. For each m, compute if 1 + steps[m] <=k. Let's call this valid_m.

3. Compute the count of numbers x <n with exactly m set bits, for each m where valid_m is true. Sum these counts, and add 1 if x=1 is included (i.e., if n>1 and k >=0, which it is since k>=1).

But how to compute the count of numbers x <n with exactly m set bits.

This is a classic digit DP problem. We can model the binary string and track the number of set bits, and whether the current prefix is tight (i.e., equal to the prefix of n up to this position). For each position, we can choose to set the bit to 0 or 1, but if the current prefix is tight, the next bit can't exceed the corresponding bit in n.

So the plan is:

- Precompute steps for all possible m (count of set bits) up to len(s).

- For each m where 1 + steps[m] <=k, compute the number of numbers x <n with exactly m set bits. Sum these counts.

- Add 1 if n>1 (since x=1 is included if k >=0, which it is).

But wait, x=1 has m=1. So for m=1, the steps is 0. So 1 + steps[1] =1 +0=1. So if k >=1, then m=1 is valid. But x=1 is handled as a separate case. So for x >=2, m=1 is allowed only if 1 + steps[1] <=k. steps[1] is 0, so 1 +0=1 <=k. So for k >=1, m=1 is valid. So numbers with m=1 (except x=1) are included.

So the sum for m=1 would include all numbers with exactly 1 set bit (i.e., powers of two) except x=1. So the count for m=1 is (number of numbers <n with exactly 1 set bit) -1 (since x=1 is already counted as a separate case).

But perhaps it's easier to compute the count for m=1 as (number of numbers <n with exactly 1 set bit) and then subtract 1 (x=1) if m=1 is valid. But this depends on whether x=1 is included in the sum.

Alternatively, the sum for m=1 would include x=1, but since x=1 is handled as a separate case, we need to subtract it.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's think again.

The total count is:

count = (1 if n>1 else 0) + sum_{m} (count_m) 

where count_m is the number of x >=2, x <n, with exactly m set bits, and 1 + steps[m] <=k.

But for m=1, the numbers with exactly 1 set bit are 2,4,8,... (powers of two). So for x >=2, m=1 is allowed if 1 + steps[1] <=k. steps[1] is 0, so 1 +0=1 <=k. Since k >=1, this is allowed. So for m=1, count_m is (number of numbers <n with exactly 1 set bit) -1 (since x=1 is excluded from this sum).

So the approach is:

For each m in 0..max_m:

if m ==0: skip (since x is positive, so m can't be 0)

else:

if 1 + steps[m] <=k:

if m ==1:

count_m = (number of numbers <n with exactly 1 set bit) -1

else:

count_m = number of numbers <n with exactly m set bits

sum all count_m and add 1 if n>1.

But how to compute the number of numbers <n with exactly m set bits.

This is a standard problem that can be solved with a digit DP approach. The binary string is processed digit by digit, tracking the number of set bits so far, and whether the current prefix is tight (i.e., equal to the prefix of n up to this position). For each position, we can choose to set the bit to 0 or 1, but if the current prefix is tight, the next bit can't exceed the corresponding bit in n.

So the digit DP function would return the count of numbers less than n with exactly m set bits.

But since m can vary, we need to track the count of set bits as part of the DP state.

The DP state can be:

- pos: current position in the binary string (from left to right, 0-based)
- tight: boolean indicating whether the current prefix is tight (i.e., equal to the prefix of n up to pos)
- cnt: the number of set bits so far
- leading_zero: boolean indicating whether the number is still leading with zeros (to handle leading zeros, but since the numbers are positive integers, leading zeros are not allowed. So leading_zero can be handled by ensuring that the first 1 is set.)

Wait, but the numbers are positive integers, so they can't have leading zeros. So the first bit must be 1. So the leading_zero can be handled by ensuring that the first bit is 1. But in the binary string, the first character is the most significant bit. So for example, the binary string "1000" represents 8. So numbers less than 8 are up to 7 (111).

So the digit DP for counting numbers with exactly m set bits less than n can be designed as follows:

We process the binary string from left to right. At each step, we track:

- The number of set bits so far (cnt)
- Whether the current prefix is tight (tight)
- Whether the number is already less than the prefix of n (is_less)

But perhaps a better way is to track tight and cnt, and for each position, decide whether to set the current bit to 0 or 1, considering the constraints.

The DP can be memoized with parameters (pos, tight, cnt). The base case is when pos == len(s), then if cnt == m, return 1, else 0.

For each position, the current bit can be 0 or 1. If tight is True, then the current bit can't exceed the corresponding bit in s. So for example, if the current bit in s is '0', then the next bit can only be 0. If it's '1', then the next bit can be 0 or 1, but if it's 1, then tight remains True, else it becomes False.

So the DP transitions are:

For each state (pos, tight, cnt):

if pos == len(s):

   return 1 if cnt == m else 0

else:

   res = 0

   max_bit = 1 if not tight else int(s[pos])

   for bit in 0..max_bit:

      new_tight = tight and (bit == max_bit)

      new_cnt = cnt + (bit == 1)

      if new_cnt > m:  # can't reach m, skip

          continue

      res += dp(pos+1, new_tight, new_cnt)

   return res

But this is for numbers with exactly m set bits. However, this counts numbers with leading zeros. For example, the number 0 (all zeros) would be counted if m=0, but since we are interested in positive integers, we need to exclude numbers with leading zeros.

Wait, but the numbers are positive integers, so they must have at least one '1' bit. So the count of numbers with exactly m set bits is the same as the count of binary numbers (without leading zeros) with exactly m set bits and less than n.

So the DP should ensure that the first '1' is set. So the leading_zero state can be added to the DP parameters. For example, leading_zero is True if all previous bits are 0. When leading_zero is True, the current bit can be 0 or 1, but if it's 0, leading_zero remains True. If it's 1, leading_zero becomes False. Only when leading_zero is False, the bits are considered part of the number.

So the DP state becomes (pos, tight, cnt, leading_zero). But this increases the state space. However, for the problem constraints, this is manageable.

Alternatively, since the numbers are positive, the first bit must be 1. So the first bit is 1, and the rest can be 0 or 1. So for the first position, the bit must be 1. So the DP can be modified to handle this.

Wait, but the binary string s can start with '1' (as per the problem statement). So for example, if s is "1000", then the numbers less than 8 are up to 7 (111). So the first bit must be 1 for numbers >=1. So the first bit is 1, and the rest can be 0 or 1, but the entire number must be less than s.

So the digit DP can be designed as follows:

The first bit must be 1. So for the first position, the bit is 1. Then, for the remaining positions, the bits can be 0 or 1, but the number must be less than s.

Wait, but this is not correct. For example, the number 1 is allowed (binary "1"), which is the first bit. So the first bit is 1, and the rest are 0. So the digit DP can start by considering the first bit as 1, and then proceed to the next bits.

So the initial state is:

pos=0, tight=True (since the first bit is 1, which is the same as s[0]), cnt=1 (since the first bit is 1), leading_zero=False.

Then, for the next positions, we can choose 0 or 1, but if tight is True, the current bit can't exceed s[pos].

So the DP can be modified to start with the first bit as 1, and then process the remaining bits.

But this approach would only count numbers that start with 1, which is correct for positive integers.

So the digit DP for counting numbers with exactly m set bits less than n can be designed as follows:

We process the binary string from left to right. The first bit must be 1. Then, for each subsequent bit, we can choose 0 or 1, but ensuring that the number remains less than n.

So the DP parameters are:

- pos: current position (starting from 0)
- tight: whether the current prefix is tight (i.e., equal to the prefix of n up to pos)
- cnt: the number of set bits so far (including the first bit)
- leading_zero: whether the number is still leading with zeros (but since the first bit is 1, leading_zero is False after the first position)

Wait, but after the first position, leading_zero is always False. So perhaps leading_zero is not needed as a parameter. Because the first bit is 1, so leading_zero is False from the start.

So the DP parameters are (pos, tight, cnt).

The initial state is pos=0, tight=True (since the first bit is 1, which is the same as s[0]), cnt=1.

Then, for each subsequent position (pos >=1), we can choose 0 or 1, but if tight is True, the current bit can't exceed s[pos].

The base case is when pos == len(s) -1 (since the first bit is processed at pos 0, and the rest are processed from pos 1 to len(s)-1). Wait, no. The binary string s has len(s) bits. For example, "1000" has 4 bits. The first bit is processed at pos 0, then pos 1, 2, 3.

So the DP starts at pos=0, then proceeds to pos=1, etc., until pos = len(s)-1.

At each step, the current bit can be 0 or 1, but if tight is True, the current bit can't exceed s[pos].

The count of set bits is tracked as cnt. For each bit chosen, if it's 1, cnt increases by 1.

At the end (pos == len(s)-1), the number is valid if cnt == m.

But wait, the first bit is 1, so cnt starts at 1. Then, for the remaining bits, each 1 adds to cnt.

So the DP function would return the number of numbers with exactly m set bits, starting with 1, and less than n.

But how to handle numbers that are shorter than len(s) bits. For example, if s is "1000" (4 bits), then numbers with 3 bits (like 7, which is 111) are also less than 8. So the digit DP must account for numbers with fewer bits.

Wait, but the numbers are positive integers, so they can have 1, 2, ..., len(s)-1 bits. For example, if s is "1000" (4 bits), numbers with 1, 2, or 3 bits are all less than 8.

So the digit DP must count all numbers with exactly m set bits, and with length less than len(s) bits, plus numbers with len(s) bits that are less than n.

So the approach is:

The total count is the sum of:

1. Numbers with length < len(s) bits and exactly m set bits.

2. Numbers with length len(s) bits, less than n, and exactly m set bits.

So for part 1, numbers with length l < len(s) bits. For each l from 1 to len(s)-1, the number of such numbers is C(l-1, m-1), since the first bit is 1, and the remaining l-1 bits have m-1 set bits. But this is only valid if m-1 >=0 and l-1 >= m-1. So for each l, the count is C(l-1, m-1) if m-1 <= l-1 and m >=1.

For part 2, the count is the result of the digit DP for numbers with exactly m set bits and len(s) bits, less than n.

So combining these two parts gives the total count.

This approach can be more efficient, as the combinatorial part (part 1) can be precomputed using combinatorial numbers, and the digit DP (part 2) can be computed for each m.

So the steps are:

For each m:

count_part1 = sum_{l=1 to len(s)-1} C(l-1, m-1) if m >=1 and l >=m.

count_part2 = digit_dp(s, m)

total_count = count_part1 + count_part2

But how to compute the combinatorial numbers C(n, k) for n up to 800-1=799, and k up to 799.

We can precompute a combinatorial table using dynamic programming. For example, C(n, k) is the number of ways to choose k items from n, which is n choose k. We can precompute a 2D array comb where comb[n][k] is the value of C(n, k) modulo 1e9+7.

But for n up to 800, and k up to 800, this is manageable.

So the plan is:

1. Precompute steps[m] for all m up to len(s).

2. Precompute combinatorial numbers C(n, k) for n up to len(s)-1 and k up to len(s)-1.

3. For each m where 1 + steps[m] <=k:

   a. Compute count_part1: sum over l from 1 to len(s)-1 of C(l-1, m-1) if m >=1 and l >=m.

   b. Compute count_part2: digit DP for numbers with exactly m set bits and len(s) bits, less than n.

   c. total_count_m = (count_part1 + count_part2) % MOD

4. Sum all total_count_m for valid m, and add 1 if n>1.

But wait, for m=1:

count_part1 is sum over l from 1 to len(s)-1 of C(l-1, 0) (since m-1=0). C(l-1, 0) is 1 for any l >=1. So the sum is len(s)-1.

count_part2 is the digit DP for numbers with exactly 1 set bit and len(s) bits, less than n.

For example, if s is "1000" (len=4), then numbers with 4 bits and exactly 1 set bit are 1000 (8), which is not less than 8. So count_part2 is 0. So the total for m=1 is (3) +0=3. But in example 2, the answer is 6. So perhaps this approach is not correct.

Wait, example 2:

Input: s = "1000" (n=8), k=2.

The output is 6. The numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6.

For m=1: steps[1] is 0. 1 +0=1 <=2. So m=1 is valid.

count_part1 for m=1 is sum over l=1 to 3 (since len(s)-1=3) of C(l-1, 0). For l=1: C(0,0)=1. l=2: C(1,0)=1. l=3: C(2,0)=1. Sum is 3.

count_part2 is numbers with 4 bits, exactly 1 set bit, and less than 8. The only such number is 1000 (8), which is not less than 8. So count_part2 is 0. So total for m=1 is 3.

But the example includes 4 (100) which is 3 bits. So count_part1 for m=1 includes numbers with 1,2,3 bits. For m=1, the numbers are 1 (1), 2 (10), 4 (100), 8 (1000), etc. But in count_part1, for l=3 (3 bits), the numbers are 100 (4), 010 (2), 001 (1). Wait, no. Wait, for l=3 bits, the first bit is 1, and the remaining 2 bits can have m-1=0 set bits. So the remaining bits must be 0. So the number is 100 (4). So for l=3, count_part1 for m=1 is 1. So sum for l=1 to 3 is 1 (l=1) +1 (l=2) +1 (l=3) =3. So the numbers are 1, 2,4. But in example 2, the numbers with m=1 are 1,2,4. But the example's answer includes 1,2,4, but also 3,5,6. So for m=2 and m=3.

So for m=2: steps[2] is 1. 1+1=2 <=2. So valid.

count_part1 for m=2 is sum over l=1 to 3 of C(l-1, 1). For l=1: C(0,1) is 0. l=2: C(1,1)=1. l=3: C(2,1)=2. Sum is 0+1+2=3.

count_part2 for m=2: numbers with 4 bits, exactly 2 set bits, less than 8. These are 0110 (6), 0101 (5), 0011 (3), 1010 (10 is 1010 in 4 bits, but 10 is 1010 which is 10 in decimal, which is 10>8. So no. Wait, 4 bits numbers less than 8 are up to 7 (0111). So for 4 bits, the first bit is 1. So the numbers are 1000 (8) which is not less than 8. So count_part2 for m=2 is the numbers with 4 bits, exactly 2 set bits, and less than 8. The first bit is 1, so the remaining 3 bits must have 1 set bit. The possible numbers are 1010 (10) is 10>8. 1001 (9) is 9>8. 1100 (12) is 12>8. So no. So count_part2 is 0. So total for m=2 is 3+0=3.

Similarly, for m=3: steps[3] is 2. 1+2=3>2. So invalid.

So the sum for m=1 and m=2 is 3+3=6. Adding 1 (since n=8>1) gives 7. But the example's answer is 6. Wait, this suggests a mistake in the approach.

Wait, example 2's answer is 6. The numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6. Let's see:

For x=3: binary 11. count of set bits is 2. steps is 1 + steps[2] =1+1=2 <=2. So valid.

For x=5: binary 101. count is 2. steps is 1+1=2.

For x=6: binary 110. count is 2. steps is 1+1=2.

So for m=2, the count_part1 is 3 (numbers with 2 set bits and length 2 or 3 bits). For length 2: 11 (3). For length 3: 101 (5), 110 (6), 011 (3) but leading zeros are not allowed. Wait, no. For length 3, the first bit is 1. So the remaining two bits can have 1 set bit. So possible numbers are 101 (5), 110 (6), 100 (4) no, wait, 100 has 1 set bit. So for m=2, the count_part1 for l=3 is C(2,1) =2. So numbers are 101 (5), 110 (6). So count_part1 for m=2 is 1 (l=2) + 2 (l=3) =3. So the numbers are 3 (11), 5 (101), 6 (110). So count_part1 for m=2 is 3. So the sum for m=1 and m=2 is 3+3=6. Adding 1 (x=1) gives 7. But the example's answer is 6. What's wrong here?

Ah, because x=1 is included in the sum for m=1. So in the approach, the sum for m=1 includes x=1. But according to the problem statement, x=1 is a separate case. So the approach is incorrect.

Wait, the approach is:

count = (1 if n>1 else 0) + sum_{m} (count_m)

where count_m is the number of x >=2, x <n, with exactly m set bits and 1 + steps[m] <=k.

But in the current approach, the sum for m=1 includes x=1 (if m=1 is valid). Because for m=1, count_part1 includes numbers with l=1 (which is x=1), and count_part2 includes numbers with len(s) bits. So the sum for m=1 includes x=1, which is already counted in the (1 if n>1 else 0) term.

So this leads to double-counting. For example, in example 2, the sum for m=1 includes x=1 (count_part1 for l=1 is 1), and the (1 if n>1 else 0) term is 1. So the total would be 1 (from x=1) + 3 (m=1) +3 (m=2) =7, but the correct answer is 6.

So the mistake is that the sum for m=1 includes x=1, which is already counted in the separate term. So the approach should be:

The sum for m=1 should exclude x=1. So for m=1, count_part1 is sum over l=2 to len(s)-1 of C(l-1, 0) (since m-1=0). Because l=1 corresponds to x=1, which is handled separately.

So the correct approach is:

For m=1:

count_part1 = sum_{l=2 to len(s)-1} C(l-1, 0) = sum_{l=2 to len(s)-1} 1 = (len(s)-1 -1) = len(s)-2.

count_part2 is the number of numbers with len(s) bits, exactly 1 set bit, and less than n. For example, in example 2, len(s) is 4. So numbers with 4 bits and exactly 1 set bit are 1000 (8), which is not less than 8. So count_part2 is 0.

So for m=1, the count is (len(s)-2) +0.

In example 2, len(s) is 4. So count_part1 is 4-2=2. So the numbers are l=2 (10) and l=3 (100). So x=2 and 4. So count_part1 is 2. Then, count_part2 is 0. So total for m=1 is 2.

Then, the sum for m=1 and m=2 is 2+3=5. Adding 1 (x=1) gives 6, which matches the example.

So the correct approach is:

For each m:

if m ==1:

   count_part1 = sum_{l=2 to len(s)-1} C(l-1, 0) = (len(s)-1 -1) = len(s)-2.

   count_part2 = digit DP for numbers with len(s) bits, exactly 1 set bit, and less than n.

   count_m = (count_part1 + count_part2) 

else:

   count_part1 = sum_{l=1 to len(s)-1} C(l-1, m-1) if m >=1 and l >=m.

   count_part2 = digit DP for numbers with len(s) bits, exactly m set bits, and less than n.

   count_m = (count_part1 + count_part2)

So the sum for m=1 is (len(s)-2) + count_part2.

This way, x=1 is counted in the separate term (1 if n>1), and the sum for m=1 does not include x=1.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute steps[m] for all m up to len(s).

2. Precompute combinatorial numbers C(n, k) for n up to len(s)-1 and k up to len(s)-1.

3. For each m where 1 + steps[m] <=k:

   a. If m ==1:

      i. count_part1 = max(0, len(s)-2) (since l starts from 2 to len(s)-1)

      ii. count_part2 = digit DP for numbers with len(s) bits, exactly 1 set bit, and less than n.

      iii. count_m = count_part1 + count_part2

   b. Else:

      i. count_part1 = sum over l from 1 to len(s)-1 of C(l-1, m-1) if l >=m.

      ii. count_part2 = digit DP for numbers with len(s) bits, exactly m set bits, and less than n.

      iii. count_m = count_part1 + count_part2

4. Sum all count_m for valid m.

5. Add 1 if n>1.

So this approach should avoid double-counting x=1.

Now, the next step is to implement this in Python.

But first, let's think about how to compute the digit DP for numbers with exactly m set bits and less than n.

The digit DP for part 2 (numbers with len(s) bits) can be implemented as follows:

We need to count the numbers that have exactly m set bits, start with 1 (since they are len(s) bits), and are less than n.

The binary string s is given. So the number must be less than s, which is a len(s)-bit number.

The digit DP for this part can be implemented with memoization, tracking the current position, the number of set bits so far, and whether the current prefix is tight.

The parameters for the DP are:

- pos: current position (starting from 0)
- cnt: number of set bits so far (starts at 1, since the first bit is 1)
- tight: whether the current prefix is equal to s up to this position.

The base case is when pos == len(s) -1. Then, if cnt ==m, return 1, else 0.

For each position, the current bit can be 0 or 1. But if tight is True, the current bit can't exceed s[pos].

So the transitions are:

For each state (pos, cnt, tight):

if pos == len(s) -1:

   return 1 if cnt ==m else 0

else:

   res =0

   max_bit = 1 if not tight else int(s[pos])

   for bit in 0..max_bit:

      new_tight = tight and (bit == max_bit)

      new_cnt = cnt + (bit ==1)

      if new_cnt >m:

          continue

      res += dp(pos+1, new_cnt, new_tight)

   return res

But this is a recursive approach, which may be slow for large len(s) (up to 800). So we need to memoize this.

We can use lru_cache for memoization, but since the parameters can be up to 800 for pos, 800 for cnt, and 2 for tight, the total number of states is 800 * 800 * 2 = 1,280,000, which is manageable.

But in Python, for recursive functions with large parameters, the recursion depth can be a problem. So it's better to implement this with memoization using a decorator, but for len(s) up to 800, the recursion depth would be 800, which is acceptable.

Alternatively, we can implement this with memoization using a dictionary.

But for the purposes of code, let's proceed.

Now, the code steps:

First, precompute the steps for all m up to len(s).

We can compute steps[m] using memoization. For m=1, steps is 0. For m>1, steps[m] = 1 + steps[count_set_bits(m)].

But count_set_bits(m) is the number of 1s in the binary representation of m.

So we can precompute steps using a memoization dictionary.

For example:

memo_steps = {}

def compute_steps(m):

    if m ==1:

        return 0

    if m in memo_steps:

        return memo_steps[m]

    c = bin(m).count('1')

    res = 1 + compute_steps(c)

    memo_steps[m] = res

    return res

But for m up to 800, this is manageable.

Next, precompute the combinatorial numbers C(n, k) for n up to 800 and k up to 800.

We can compute this using dynamic programming:

comb = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]

comb[0][0] =1

for n in range(1, max_n+1):

    comb[n][0] =1

    for k in range(1, n+1):

        comb[n][k] = (comb[n-1][k-1] + comb[n-1][k]) % MOD

But max_n is len(s)-1, which can be up to 800-1=799.

So for each l from 1 to len(s)-1, and for each m, compute C(l-1, m-1).

Now, the code outline:

MOD = 10**9 +7

class Solution:

    def countKReducibleNumbers(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:

        n = int(s, 2)

        if n ==1:

            return 0

        len_s = len(s)

        # Precompute steps for m up to len_s

        memo_steps = {}

        def compute_steps(m):

            if m ==1:

                return 0

            if m in memo_steps:

                return memo_steps[m]

            c = bin(m).count('1')

            res = 1 + compute_steps(c)

            memo_steps[m] = res

            return res

        # Precompute combinatorial numbers C(n, k) up to len_s-1 choose k

        max_comb_n = len_s -1

        comb = [[0]*(max_comb_n+1) for _ in range(max_comb_n+1)]

        comb[0][0] =1

        for n in range(1, max_comb_n+1):

            comb[n][0] =1

            for k in range(1, n+1):

                comb[n][k] = (comb[n-1][k-1] + comb[n-1][k]) % MOD

        valid_ms = []

        for m in range(1, len_s +1):

                # Wait, the first bit is 1, so cnt starts at 1.

                # So for m=1, the remaining bits must have 0 set bits.

                # So the number is 1000...0 (len_s bits). So the digit DP for m=1 is 1 if the number is less than s.

                # But the first bit is 1, and the rest are 0. So the number is 2^(len_s-1). We need to check if this is less than n.

                # For example, if s is "1000" (8), then 2^(3) =8 is not less than 8. So count_part2 is 0.

                # So for m=1, the count_part2 is 1 if 2^(len_s-1) <n, else 0.

                # But how to compute this.

                # The number is 1 followed by (len_s-1) zeros. So its value is 2^(len_s-1).

                # So if 2^(len_s-1) <n, then count_part2 is 1, else 0.

                # But how to compute this in the digit DP.

                # The digit DP for m=1 would have cnt=1, and the remaining bits must be 0.

                # So the digit DP for m=1 is 1 if the number 100...0 (len_s bits) is less than s.

                # So the number is 100...0 (len_s bits) is 2^(len_s-1).

                # So compare 2^(len_s-1) with n.

                # But n is given as a binary string. So we can compute 2^(len_s-1) as '1' followed by (len_s-1) zeros.

                # So compare s with '1' followed by (len_s-1) zeros.

                # For example, s is "1000" (len_s=4). The number is 1000 (8), which is equal to n. So count_part2 is 0.

                # So for m=1, count_part2 is 1 if the number 100...0 (len_s bits) is less than s.

                # So how to compute this.

                # The number is '1' followed by (len_s-1) zeros. So the binary string is '1' + '0'*(len_s-1).

                # Compare this string with s.

                # If it is less than s, then count_part2 is 1, else 0.

                # Wait, the first bit is 1, so cnt starts at 1.

                # So for the digit DP, we start at pos=0, cnt=1, tight=True.

                # But for m=1, the code above is handled separately.

                # So for m !=1:

                # count_part2 is the result of the digit DP for numbers with len_s bits, exactly m set bits, and less than s.

                # So the digit DP function needs to be parametrized by m.

                # But the current code for dp_part2 is inside the loop over m, which is not possible.

                # So this approach won't work. We need to create a new dp function for each m.

                # This is a problem. Because the dp_part2 function is defined inside the loop over m, but in Python, functions are not nested in loops in this way.

                # So this approach is not feasible. We need to find a way to compute the digit DP for each m.

                # So perhaps the digit DP function should be modified to take m as a parameter.

                # But how to memoize it.

                # Alternative approach: precompute for all possible m, the digit DP for numbers with len_s bits, exactly m set bits, and less than s.

                # But this would require a separate DP for each m, which is not feasible.

                # So perhaps the digit DP function should be rewritten to take m as a parameter and use memoization with m as part of the key.

                # But this would increase the state space.

                # So the solution is to create a new memoization function for each m.

                # But this is not practical in Python.

                # Alternative idea: precompute all possible m's and their digit DP results in a single pass.

                # But this is challenging.

                # So perhaps the digit DP function should be rewritten to take m as a parameter and use memoization with (pos, cnt, tight, m) as the key.

                # But this would increase the state space, but for len_s up to 800, and m up to 800, it's manageable.

                # So let's modify the digit DP function to take m as a parameter.

                # So the function would be:
