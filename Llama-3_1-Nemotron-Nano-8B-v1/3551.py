Okay, I need to solve this problem where for each query, I have to find the maximum XOR score of any subarray within a given range. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, let's understand the XOR score calculation. The process is to repeatedly XOR adjacent elements and keep the last element. For example, for a subarray of length k, the XOR score is computed in (k-1) steps. Each step reduces the array size by 1 until only one element remains. 

Wait, the example given in the first problem: for [2,8,4], the steps would be:
First step: 2^8=10, 8^4=12. Then the array becomes [10,12]. Next step: 10^12=6. So the final score is 6. But the example says the maximum is 12. Oh right, because the maximum is taken over all possible subarrays. So for the subarray [8,4], the XOR is 12, which is higher than the entire array's 6. So the maximum is 12.

So the problem is, for each query [l_i, r_i], find the maximum XOR score among all possible subarrays of nums[l_i..r_i].

The challenge is to compute this efficiently, especially since the number of queries can be up to 1e5, and the array size is up to 2000. A naive approach of checking all possible subarrays for each query would be O(q * n^3), which is way too slow for n=2000 and q=1e5. So we need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the properties of the XOR score. For a subarray of length m, the XOR score is the result of applying m-1 XOR operations. Let's see if there's a pattern here.

Wait, for a subarray of length 1, the score is the element itself. For length 2, it's a[0]^a[1]. For length 3, it's (a[0]^a[1])^(a[1]^a[2]) = a[0] ^ a[2], because (a^b)^b = a. Wait, no. Let's compute step by step. For [a, b, c], first step: a^b and b^c. Then the next step is (a^b) ^ (b^c). Let's expand that: a^b ^ b^c = a ^ (b^b) ^ c = a ^ 0 ^ c = a^c. So for a subarray of length 3, the final score is a[0]^a[2]. Interesting.

Wait, what about length 4? Let's take [a, b, c, d]. First step: a^b, b^c, c^d. Then the array becomes [a^b, b^c, c^d]. Next step: (a^b)^(b^c) and (b^c)^(c^d). Then the array is [ (a^b)^(b^c), (b^c)^(c^d) ]. Then the next step is (a^b^b^c) ^ (b^c^c^d) = a ^ c ^ b ^ d. Wait, maybe there's a pattern here. Let's see:

For length m, the final XOR is the XOR of elements at even indices? Or maybe some other pattern. Let's see:

Length 1: a0
Length 2: a0^a1
Length 3: a0^a2
Length 4: a0^a2^a3^a1? Or maybe not. Let's compute for length 4.

Wait, let's take a concrete example. Let's say the subarray is [a, b, c, d].

Step 1: compute a^b, b^c, c^d → new array [x, y, z] where x = a^b, y = b^c, z = c^d.

Step 2: compute x^y, y^z → new array [ (a^b)^(b^c), (b^c)^(c^d) ].

Step 3: compute (a^b^b^c) ^ (b^c^c^d) → a ^ c ^ d. Because (a^b) ^ (b^c) = a ^ c (since b^b cancels out), and (b^c) ^ (c^d) = b ^ d. Then the next step is (a^c) ^ (b^d) = a^b^c^d. Wait, no. Let me compute step by step:

Wait, after step 2, the array is [ (a^b)^(b^c), (b^c)^(c^d) ].

So step 3 is ( (a^b)^(b^c) ) ^ ( (b^c)^(c^d) ) 

= a^b ^ b^c ^ b^c ^ c^d 

= a^b ^ (b^c ^ b^c) ^ c^d 

= a^b ^ 0 ^ c^d 

= a^b ^ c^d 

= a ^ b ^ c ^ d 

Wait, that's the XOR of all elements. So for a subarray of length 4, the final score is a^b^c^d. 

Hmm, that's interesting. Let's see for other lengths:

Length 1: a0
Length 2: a0^a1
Length 3: a0^a2
Length 4: a0^a1^a2^a3
Length 5: a0^a2^a4
Length 6: a0^a1^a3^a4^a5? Or maybe not. Let's test with length 5.

Take [a, b, c, d, e].

Step 1: a^b, b^c, c^d, d^e → [x, y, z, w]

Step 2: x^y, y^z, z^w → [ (a^b)^(b^c), (b^c)^(c^d), (c^d)^(d^e) ]

Step 3: (x^y) ^ (y^z), (y^z) ^ (z^w) → [ (a^b^c) ^ (b^c^c^d), (b^c^d) ^ (c^d^d^e) ]

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a pattern based on the parity of the length. Let's see:

For even length m, the final XOR is the XOR of all elements. For odd length m, the final XOR is the XOR of elements at even indices (0-based) in the original subarray. Or maybe the other way around. Let's check:

Length 2 (even): XOR of all elements (a0^a1) → yes.

Length 3 (odd): a0^a2 → which is the XOR of elements at even indices (0 and 2).

Length 4 (even): a0^a1^a2^a3 → all elements.

Length 5 (odd): Let's compute step by step.

Subarray [a, b, c, d, e].

Step 1: a^b, b^c, c^d, d^e → [x, y, z, w]

Step 2: x^y, y^z, z^w → [ (a^b^b^c), (b^c^c^d), (c^d^d^e) ] → [a^c, b^d, c^e]

Step 3: (a^c) ^ (b^d), (b^d) ^ (c^e) → [a^c^b^d, b^d^c^e]

Step 4: (a^c^b^d) ^ (b^d^c^e) → a^c^b^d ^ b^d^c^e = a ^ e.

So for length 5, the final score is a^e. Which is the XOR of the first and last elements. Hmm, that's interesting.

So for even m, the final XOR is the XOR of all elements. For odd m, the final XOR is the XOR of elements at positions 0, 2, 4, ... (the even indices) of the original subarray. Wait, in the case of m=3, it's a0^a2. For m=5, a0^a4. So for odd m, the final XOR is the XOR of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) in the original subarray.

Wait, but for m=5, the indices are 0,1,2,3,4. The even indices are 0,2,4. So the XOR is a0 ^ a2 ^ a4. But in the example above, the result was a0 ^ a4. Wait, that's conflicting. So perhaps my previous conclusion is wrong.

Wait, in the example for m=5, the final result was a^e (assuming e is a4). So a0 ^ a4. But according to the even indices, it's a0 ^ a2 ^ a4. So that's a discrepancy. So my previous hypothesis is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps there's a different pattern. Let's see:

Looking at the examples:

m=1: a0 → XOR of a0.

m=2: a0^a1 → XOR of all elements.

m=3: a0^a2 → XOR of a0 and a2.

m=4: a0^a1^a2^a3 → XOR of all elements.

m=5: a0^a4 → XOR of a0 and a4.

m=6: a0^a1^a2^a3^a4^a5 → XOR of all elements.

So the pattern seems to be that for even m, the final XOR is the XOR of all elements. For odd m, the final XOR is the XOR of the first and last elements, then the next first and next last, etc. Wait, but for m=3, it's a0 and a2. For m=5, a0 and a4. So for odd m, the final XOR is the XOR of the first and last elements of the subarray. Because in m=3, first is a0, last is a2. XOR is a0^a2. For m=5, first is a0, last is a4. XOR is a0^a4. So for odd m, the final XOR is the XOR of the first and last elements of the subarray. But wait, in the case of m=5, the steps led to a0^a4, which is the same as the first and last elements. So perhaps for any subarray of length m, the final XOR is:

If m is even: XOR of all elements.

If m is odd: XOR of the first and last elements, then XOR with the next first and next last, etc. Wait, but in m=5, the steps led to a0^a4. So perhaps for odd m, the final XOR is the XOR of the first and last elements. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the final XOR for a subarray of length m is the XOR of the elements at positions 0, 2, 4, ... up to m-1 if m is odd. For example, m=3: 0,2. m=5: 0,2,4. But in the m=5 example, the result was a0^a4, which is not the same as a0^a2^a4. So that's conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps I need to find a general formula for the final XOR of a subarray of length m.

Let me think recursively. Let's denote the final XOR for a subarray of length m as f(m). For m=1, f(1) = a0. For m=2, f(2) = a0^a1. For m=3, f(3) = (a0^a1) ^ (a1^a2) = a0 ^ a2. For m=4, f(4) = (a0^a1) ^ (a1^a2) ^ (a2^a3) → but wait, no. Wait, for m=4, the steps are:

Step 1: a0^a1, a1^a2, a2^a3 → [x, y, z]

Step 2: x^y, y^z → [ (a0^a1)^(a1^a2), (a1^a2)^(a2^a3) ]

= [a0^a2, a1^a3]

Step 3: a0^a2 ^ a1^a3 → a0 ^ a1 ^ a2 ^ a3.

So for m=4, the final XOR is the XOR of all elements.

For m=5:

Step 1: a0^a1, a1^a2, a2^a3, a3^a4 → [x, y, z, w]

Step 2: x^y, y^z, z^w → [a0^a2, a1^a3, a2^a4]

Step 3: (a0^a2) ^ (a1^a3), (a1^a3) ^ (a2^a4) → [a0^a2^a1^a3, a1^a3^a2^a4]

Step 4: (a0^a2^a1^a3) ^ (a1^a3^a2^a4) → a0 ^ a4.

So the final result is a0 ^ a4.

So for m=5, the final XOR is a0 ^ a4.

So the pattern seems to be that for even m, the final XOR is the XOR of all elements. For odd m, the final XOR is the XOR of the first and last elements of the subarray. Because in m=3, first is a0, last is a2. m=5, first a0, last a4. So for any odd m, the final XOR is a0 ^ a_{m-1}.

Wait, but in m=3, the subarray is [a0, a1, a2]. The first is a0, last is a2. So XOR is a0^a2. Which matches the example. For m=5, the first and last are a0 and a4. So XOR is a0^a4.

But wait, what about m=7? Let's see:

Subarray [a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6].

After step 1: a0^a1, a1^a2, a2^a3, a3^a4, a4^a5, a5^a6.

Step 2: (a0^a1)^(a1^a2) = a0^a2, (a1^a2)^(a2^a3) = a1^a3, (a2^a3)^(a3^a4) = a2^a4, (a3^a4)^(a4^a5) = a3^a5, (a4^a5)^(a5^a6) = a4^a6.

Step 3: (a0^a2)^(a1^a3) = a0^a1^a2^a3, (a1^a3)^(a2^a4) = a1^a2^a3^a4, (a2^a4)^(a3^a5) = a2^a3^a4^a5, (a3^a5)^(a4^a6) = a3^a4^a5^a6.

Step 4: (a0^a1^a2^a3) ^ (a1^a2^a3^a4) = a0^a4, (a1^a2^a3^a4) ^ (a2^a3^a4^a5) = a1^a5, (a2^a3^a4^a5) ^ (a3^a4^a5^a6) = a2^a6.

Step 5: (a0^a4) ^ (a1^a5) = a0^a1^a4^a5, (a1^a5) ^ (a2^a6) = a1^a2^a5^a6.

Step 6: (a0^a1^a4^a5) ^ (a1^a2^a5^a6) = a0^a2^a4^a6.

Wait, but m=7 is odd, so according to the previous pattern, the final XOR should be a0^a6. But according to this step-by-step, it's a0^a2^a4^a6. So that's conflicting. So my previous hypothesis is incorrect.

Hmm, this complicates things. So the pattern isn't as straightforward as I thought. So perhaps there's a different way to model the final XOR.

Alternative approach: Let's model the process of reducing the array. Each step, adjacent elements are XORed, and the last element is removed. So for a subarray of length m, after m-1 steps, we get a single value.

Let's think about the process as building a binary tree. Each element in the original array is a leaf. Each internal node is the XOR of its two children. The root is the final XOR score.

For example, for m=3:

The tree would have leaves a0, a1, a2. The first level is a0^a1 and a1^a2. The second level is (a0^a1) ^ (a1^a2) = a0 ^ a2.

For m=4:

Leaves a0, a1, a2, a3.

First level: a0^a1, a1^a2, a2^a3.

Second level: (a0^a1)^(a1^a2) = a0^a2, (a1^a2)^(a2^a3) = a1^a3.

Third level: (a0^a2) ^ (a1^a3) = a0^a1^a2^a3.

So the root is the XOR of all elements.

For m=5:

Leaves a0, a1, a2, a3, a4.

First level: a0^a1, a1^a2, a2^a3, a3^a4.

Second level: (a0^a1)^(a1^a2) = a0^a2, (a1^a2)^(a2^a3) = a1^a3, (a2^a3)^(a3^a4) = a2^a4.

Third level: (a0^a2)^(a1^a3) = a0^a1^a2^a3, (a1^a3)^(a2^a4) = a1^a2^a3^a4.

Fourth level: (a0^a1^a2^a3) ^ (a1^a2^a3^a4) = a0^a4.

So the root is a0^a4.

Hmm, so for m=5, the root is a0^a4. For m=3, a0^a2. For m=7, perhaps the root is a0^a6. But in the m=7 example I tried earlier, the result was a0^a2^a4^a6. So that's conflicting. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the m=7 example.

Wait, let's re-calculate m=7.

Original array: a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6.

Step 1: compute XOR of adjacent pairs, resulting in 6 elements: a0^a1, a1^a2, a2^a3, a3^a4, a4^a5, a5^a6.

Step 2: compute XOR of adjacent pairs of the previous array, resulting in 5 elements:

(a0^a1) ^ (a1^a2) = a0^a2,

(a1^a2) ^ (a2^a3) = a1^a3,

(a2^a3) ^ (a3^a4) = a2^a4,

(a3^a4) ^ (a4^a5) = a3^a5,

(a4^a5) ^ (a5^a6) = a4^a6.

Step 3: XOR adjacent pairs of the previous array (5 elements → 4 elements):

a0^a2 ^ a1^a3 = a0^a1^a2^a3,

a1^a3 ^ a2^a4 = a1^a2^a3^a4,

a2^a4 ^ a3^a5 = a2^a3^a4^a5,

a3^a5 ^ a4^a6 = a3^a4^a5^a6.

Step 4: XOR adjacent pairs of the previous array (4 elements → 3 elements):

(a0^a1^a2^a3) ^ (a1^a2^a3^a4) = a0^a4,

(a1^a2^a3^a4) ^ (a2^a3^a4^a5) = a1^a5,

(a2^a3^a4^a5) ^ (a3^a4^a5^a6) = a2^a6.

Step 5: XOR the two elements from step 4:

a0^a4 ^ a1^a5 = a0^a1^a4^a5,

a1^a5 ^ a2^a6 = a1^a2^a5^a6.

Wait, but step 5 would have two elements, so step 5 would be their XOR. Wait, no. Wait, step 4 has 3 elements. So step 5 would process them into 2 elements. Then step 6 would process into 1 element.

Wait, let's re-calculate step 5:

After step 4, the array is [a0^a4, a1^a5, a2^a6].

Step 5: XOR adjacent pairs:

(a0^a4) ^ (a1^a5) → a0^a4^a1^a5,

(a1^a5) ^ (a2^a6) → a1^a5^a2^a6.

Now, step 6: XOR the two elements from step 5:

(a0^a4^a1^a5) ^ (a1^a5^a2^a6) = a0^a4^a2^a6.

So the final result is a0^a2^a4^a6.

But according to the previous pattern for m=5, the result was a0^a4. So for m=7, the result is a0^a2^a4^a6. So the pattern isn't as simple as first and last elements. So this complicates things.

So the problem is that the final XOR depends on the structure of the subarray and the way the XOR operations are applied. It's not straightforward to find a general formula.

Alternative approach: For each possible subarray, compute the final XOR and track the maximum. But with n=2000, the number of possible subarrays is O(n^2) = 4e6. For each query, we need to find the maximum among all subarrays within [l_i, r_i]. But if queries are up to 1e5, and each query could require checking up to 4e6 subarrays, this would be 4e11 operations, which is way too slow.

So we need a way to precompute for all possible subarrays their maximum XOR and then answer queries efficiently.

But how?

Alternative idea: For each possible subarray [i..j], precompute the maximum XOR score. Then, for each query [l, r], find the maximum value among all [i..j] where l <= i <= j <= r.

But precomputing for all possible [i..j] is O(n^2) = 4e6 for n=2000, which is manageable. Then, for each query, we can answer in O(1) time if we have a 2D range maximum query (RMQ) structure. But building a 2D RMQ for O(n^2) entries is possible, but the query time would be O(1) for each query. However, the 2D RMQ would require O(n^2 log n) preprocessing time and space, which for n=2000 would be 4e6 * 20 = 8e7 entries, which is manageable.

But how to precompute the maximum XOR for each [i..j]?

So the plan is:

1. Precompute for all possible subarrays [i..j] their maximum XOR score.

2. Build a 2D RMQ structure to answer the maximum in a rectangle [l..r] x [l..r].

3. For each query [l, r], find the maximum value in the precomputed matrix for all i >= l, j <= r.

But how to compute the maximum XOR for each [i..j]?

The key problem is step 1: for each [i..j], compute the maximum XOR score of any subarray within [i..j]. Wait, no. Wait, the problem is that for a query [l, r], we need to find the maximum XOR score of any subarray that is contained within [l, r]. So the subarray can be any [a, b] where l <= a <= b <= r. So for each query, the answer is the maximum of all possible [a, b] subarrays within [l, r].

So the precomputed matrix should store for each possible [i, j] the maximum XOR score of any subarray [a, b] where i <= a <= b <= j. Then, for a query [l, r], the answer is the value stored at [l, r].

So the problem reduces to precomputing a matrix dp[i][j], which is the maximum XOR score of any subarray [a, b] within [i, j].

Once we have this matrix, each query can be answered in O(1) time.

So the main challenge is to compute this dp matrix efficiently.

How to compute dp[i][j] for all i <= j?

The standard approach for such problems is to use dynamic programming. For each i and j, compute dp[i][j] based on smaller subproblems.

Let's think about the recurrence relation.

For a given i and j:

dp[i][j] = max( dp[i][j-1], dp[i+1][j], max_xor_subarray_in_[i, j-1], max_xor_subarray_in_[i+1, j], ... )

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, for each possible subarray [a, b], compute its XOR score, and for each [i, j], track the maximum score of all [a, b] within [i, j].

But how to compute the XOR score for each [a, b] efficiently.

Wait, the XOR score for [a, b] is the result of the reduction process. So for each [a, b], we need to compute this value.

But how to compute this value efficiently for all possible [a, b]?

Let's find a way to compute the XOR score for a subarray [a, b] in O(1) time after some pre-processing.

But how?

Let's think about the XOR reduction process again. For a subarray of length m, the final XOR is determined by the way the XOR operations are applied. But the process is similar to building a binary tree where each node is the XOR of its two children.

But perhaps there's a pattern based on the parity of the length and the positions of the elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the final XOR can be expressed as the XOR of certain elements in the subarray. For example, for even m, it's the XOR of all elements. For odd m, it's the XOR of elements at even indices. But earlier examples show that this is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the final XOR is the XOR of the elements at positions a, a+2, a+4, etc., up to the end of the subarray. For example, for m=3 (indices 0,1,2), the XOR is a0 ^ a2. For m=5 (indices 0,1,2,3,4), the XOR is a0 ^ a2 ^ a4. But in the m=5 example earlier, the result was a0^a4, which is not the same as a0^a2^a4. So this is conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps there's a different approach. Let's model the XOR reduction process for a subarray [a, b].

The process is to repeatedly apply XOR to adjacent elements and remove the last element each time. The final result is the XOR of the elements in a certain way.

Let's think recursively. For a subarray of length m:

If m == 1: the result is the element itself.

If m > 1: the result is the XOR of the first element and the result of the subarray starting at the second element, but with length m-1. Wait, no. Because when you XOR the first two elements, you get a new array of length m-1, and then you proceed. So the result is (a0 ^ a1) XOR (result of the subarray [a1, a2, ..., a_{m-1}]).

But this seems like a recursive approach, but it's not clear how to model it.

Alternatively, perhaps the final XOR can be represented as the XOR of the elements at certain positions. For example, for m=3, the result is a0 ^ a2. For m=5, a0 ^ a4. For m=7, a0 ^ a6. So for odd m, the result is a0 ^ a_{m-1}. For even m, the result is the XOR of all elements.

But in the m=7 example, the result was a0^a2^a4^a6, which is not a0^a6. So this hypothesis is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps for even m, the result is the XOR of all elements, and for odd m, the result is the XOR of the first and last elements, then the next first and next last, etc. For example, m=3: a0 and a2. m=5: a0 and a4, then a1 and a3. Then XOR those results. Wait, but in the m=5 example, the result was a0^a4. So perhaps for odd m, the result is the XOR of the first and last elements, then the second and second last, etc., but only for the first (m-1)/2 pairs.

Wait, for m=3: (a0, a2) → XOR is a0^a2.

For m=5: (a0, a4) and (a1, a3). XOR those two results: (a0^a4) ^ (a1^a3). But in the example, the result was a0^a4, which is not the same as (a0^a4) ^ (a1^a3). So this is conflicting.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different way to model the XOR reduction.

Another idea: The XOR reduction process is similar to a binary operation that combines elements in a certain way. For example, the process can be viewed as building a binary tree where each level combines pairs of elements. The final result is the XOR of all the leaves in the tree, but the structure of the tree depends on the order of operations.

But the order of operations is fixed: in each step, adjacent elements are XORed, and the last element is removed. So the structure of the tree is determined by the initial array.

But how to model this for any subarray?

Alternative approach: For each possible subarray [a, b], compute the XOR score by simulating the reduction process. But for n=2000, the number of subarrays is O(n^2) = 4e6. For each subarray, the reduction process takes O(m) time, where m is the length of the subarray. So for a subarray of length 2000, it would take 2000 steps. So the total time would be O(n^3), which is 8e9 operations. That's way too slow.

So this approach is not feasible.

We need a way to compute the XOR score for a subarray [a, b] in O(1) or O(log n) time.

Let's think about the parity of the length of the subarray. For even length, the final XOR is the XOR of all elements. For odd length, it's the XOR of the first and last elements, then the next first and next last, etc. But how?

Wait, let's take m=5. The subarray is [a0, a1, a2, a3, a4]. The steps are:

Step 1: a0^a1, a1^a2, a2^a3, a3^a4 → [x, y, z, w]

Step 2: x^y, y^z, z^w → [a0^a2, a1^a3, a2^a4]

Step 3: (a0^a2) ^ (a1^a3) → a0^a1^a2^a3, (a1^a3) ^ (a2^a4) → a1^a2^a3^a4.

Step 4: (a0^a1^a2^a3) ^ (a1^a2^a3^a4) → a0^a4.

So the final result is a0^a4. Which is the XOR of the first and last elements. So for m=5, the result is a0^a4.

For m=3, the result is a0^a2.

For m=7, the result is a0^a6.

So for odd m, the result is the XOR of the first and last elements of the subarray.

For even m, the result is the XOR of all elements.

Wait, but in the m=7 example I tried earlier, the result was a0^a2^a4^a6. But according to this hypothesis, it should be a0^a6. So there's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the m=7 example. Let me re-calculate.

Subarray [a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6] (m=7).

Step 1: compute adjacent XORs → [a0^a1, a1^a2, a2^a3, a3^a4, a4^a5, a5^a6].

Step 2: compute adjacent XORs of the previous array → [ (a0^a1)^(a1^a2) = a0^a2, (a1^a2)^(a2^a3) = a1^a3, (a2^a3)^(a3^a4) = a2^a4, (a3^a4)^(a4^a5) = a3^a5, (a4^a5)^(a5^a6) = a4^a6 ].

Step 3: compute adjacent XORs → [a0^a2 ^ a1^a3 = a0^a1^a2^a3, a1^a3 ^ a2^a4 = a1^a2^a3^a4, a2^a4 ^ a3^a5 = a2^a3^a4^a5, a3^a5 ^ a4^a6 = a3^a4^a5^a6 ].

Step 4: compute adjacent XORs → [ (a0^a1^a2^a3) ^ (a1^a2^a3^a4) = a0^a4, (a1^a2^a3^a4) ^ (a2^a3^a4^a5) = a1^a5, (a2^a3^a4^a5) ^ (a3^a4^a5^a6) = a2^a6 ].

Step 5: compute adjacent XORs → [a0^a4 ^ a1^a5 = a0^a1^a4^a5, a1^a5 ^ a2^a6 = a1^a2^a5^a6 ].

Step 6: compute adjacent XOR → [ (a0^a1^a4^a5) ^ (a1^a2^a5^a6) ] = a0^a2^a4^a6.

So the final result is a0^a2^a4^a6, which is not the same as a0^a6. So the hypothesis that for odd m, the result is a0^a_{m-1} is incorrect.

This suggests that the pattern is more complex. So perhaps the final XOR for a subarray of length m is the XOR of the elements at even indices (0-based) in the original subarray. For m=3, indices 0 and 2. For m=5, indices 0, 2, 4. For m=7, indices 0, 2, 4, 6. So the XOR of all even-indexed elements.

But in the m=5 example, the result was a0^a4, which is the XOR of indices 0 and 4. But according to this hypothesis, it should be a0^a2^a4. So this is conflicting.

Hmm, this is getting really complicated. Maybe there's a different approach.

Alternative idea: For each possible subarray [a, b], compute the XOR score by noting that the process is equivalent to XORing elements in a certain way. For example, the final XOR is the XOR of elements at positions a, a+2, a+4, etc., up to b if the length is odd, or up to b-1 if the length is even. But this doesn't seem to hold.

Alternatively, perhaps the final XOR is the XOR of the elements at positions a, a+1, a+3, a+4, etc. But this is just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the final XOR can be represented as the XOR of the elements at positions a and b, then a+1 and b-1, and so on, until all elements are processed. For example, for m=5 (a=0, b=4):

XOR a0 and a4 → x.

XOR a1 and a3 → y.

XOR x and y → x^y = a0^a4^a1^a3.

But in the example, the result was a0^a4. So this is not matching.

Hmm.

Another approach: Let's think about the parity of the length. For even m, the final XOR is the XOR of all elements. For odd m, the final XOR is the XOR of the first and last elements, then the next first and next last, etc. But how?

For m=3: a0 and a2 → XOR is a0^a2.

For m=5: a0 and a4, then a1 and a3 → XOR is (a0^a4) ^ (a1^a3). But in the example, the result was a0^a4. So this is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps for odd m, the final XOR is the XOR of the first and last elements. For even m, the XOR of all elements.

But in the m=7 example, the result was a0^a2^a4^a6, which is the XOR of all even-indexed elements. So this hypothesis is also incorrect.

This suggests that there's no simple pattern based on parity. So perhaps the only way to compute the XOR score for a subarray is to simulate the process. But for n=2000, this would be O(n^3), which is not feasible.

Alternative idea: Precompute for all possible subarrays [a, b] their XOR score using dynamic programming. For each possible length and starting index, compute the XOR score.

Let's define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the XOR score of the subarray starting at i and ending at j.

We can compute this using the following recurrence:

For a subarray of length 1: dp[i][i] = nums[i].

For a subarray of length m > 1:

The XOR score is the XOR of the first element and the XOR score of the subarray starting at i+1 and ending at j, but with length m-1. Wait, no. Because when you XOR the first two elements, you get a new array of length m-1, and then you proceed. So the XOR score for [i, j] is (nums[i] ^ nums[i+1]) XOR the XOR score of the subarray [i+1, j-1], but this seems incorrect.

Alternatively, the XOR score for [i, j] can be computed as the XOR of the first element and the XOR score of the subarray [i+1, j], but this also doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the XOR score for [i, j] can be computed as the XOR of the first element and the XOR score of the subarray [i+1, j], but this is not correct.

This approach doesn't seem to lead anywhere.

Another idea: The XOR reduction process is similar to the process of building a prefix XOR array. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final XOR can be computed using a sliding window approach. For example, for a subarray of length m, the final XOR is the XOR of the elements at even positions. But this is not supported by the examples.

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the examples.

Looking at the first example:

nums = [2,8,4,32,16,1]

For the subarray [0,2] (elements 2,8,4), the maximum XOR is 12, which is from the subarray [8,4]. The XOR score for this subarray is 8^4=12.

For the subarray [1,4] (elements 8,4,32,16), the maximum is 60, which is from the entire subarray. The XOR score is 8^4^32^16 = 60.

For the subarray [0,5], the maximum is 60, which is the same as the previous query.

So for even-length subarrays, the XOR score is the XOR of all elements. For the subarray [8,4,32,16], which has length 4 (even), the XOR is 8^4^32^16 = 60.

For the subarray [8,4], which has length 2 (even), the XOR is 12.

For the subarray [2,8,4], which has length 3 (odd), the maximum is 12, which is from the subarray [8,4] (even length).

So the maximum for a query can come from a subarray of even or odd length.

But how to find the maximum for all possible subarrays within a given range.

Another observation: The maximum XOR score for a subarray [a, b] is the maximum between:

- The maximum XOR score of any subarray within [a, b-1].

- The maximum XOR score of any subarray within [a+1, b].

- The XOR score of the subarray [a, b].

But this is the standard approach for dynamic programming for problems like maximum subarray sum. However, for each [a, b], this would take O(1) time if we have the precomputed values for [a, b-1] and [a+1, b]. But the problem is that the XOR score of [a, b] is not easily computable from previous values.

So the recurrence would be:

dp[a][b] = max( dp[a][b-1], dp[a+1][b], xor_score(a, b) )

But to compute xor_score(a, b), we need an efficient way.

If we can compute xor_score(a, b) in O(1) time, then the overall time for precomputing the dp matrix would be O(n^2), which is acceptable.

So the key is to find a way to compute xor_score(a, b) efficiently.

But how?

Let's think about the XOR reduction process again. For a subarray of length m, the final XOR is the result of applying m-1 XOR operations. Each step reduces the array size by 1.

But perhaps there's a way to model this using a prefix XOR array or some other structure.

Another idea: The XOR reduction process for a subarray [a, b] can be viewed as building a binary tree where each node is the XOR of its two children. The root is the final XOR score. The structure of the tree depends on the order of operations. But the order is fixed: in each step, adjacent elements are XORed, and the last element is removed.

But how to model this for any subarray.

Alternatively, perhaps the final XOR is the XOR of the elements at positions a, a+2, a+4, etc., up to b if the length is odd, or up to b-1 if the length is even. But this doesn't hold for the examples.

Alternatively, perhaps the final XOR is the XOR of the elements at even indices in the original subarray. For example, for m=3 (indices 0,1,2), even indices are 0 and 2. XOR is a0^a2. For m=5 (indices 0-4), even indices are 0,2,4. XOR is a0^a2^a4. But in the example for m=5, the result was a0^a4, which is not the same. So this is conflicting.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Alternative approach: For each possible subarray [a, b], compute the XOR score by simulating the process. But with n=2000, this would be O(n^3) time, which is 8e9 operations. That's way too slow. But perhaps there's a way to optimize this.

Wait, but for a subarray of length m, the XOR score can be computed in O(m) time. For n=2000, the total number of subarrays is O(n^2) = 4e6. For each subarray, the average length is O(n), so total time is O(n^3) = 8e9 operations. Which is way too slow.

But perhaps there's a way to compute the XOR score for all subarrays in O(n^2) time.

Let's think about the XOR reduction process for a subarray [a, b]. The process is to repeatedly XOR adjacent elements and remove the last element each time. The final result is the XOR of the elements in a certain way.

But perhaps the final result can be computed using a sliding window approach. For example, for a subarray of length m, the final result is the XOR of the elements at positions a, a+2, a+4, etc., up to b if m is odd, or up to b-1 if m is even. But this is just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the final result is the XOR of the elements at positions a and b, then a+1 and b-1, and so on. For example, for m=5 (a=0, b=4):

XOR a0 and a4 → x.

XOR a1 and a3 → y.

XOR x and y → x^y = a0^a4^a1^a3.

But in the example, the result was a0^a4. So this is not matching.

Hmm.

Another idea: The final XOR is the XOR of the elements at even positions in the original subarray. For example, for m=3, even positions are 0 and 2. For m=5, even positions are 0, 2, 4. For m=7, even positions are 0, 2, 4, 6. So the XOR of all even-indexed elements.

But in the m=5 example, the result was a0^a4, which is the XOR of indices 0 and 4. But according to this hypothesis, it should be a0^a2^a4. So this is conflicting.

At this point, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for a different way to model the problem.

Alternative idea: The maximum XOR score for a subarray [a, b] is the maximum of all possible XOR scores of subarrays within [a, b]. So for each query [l, r], the answer is the maximum of all possible subarrays [i, j] where l <= i <= j <= r.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Another observation: The maximum XOR score for a subarray [i, j] is either:

- The maximum XOR score of a subarray of even length within [i, j], which is the XOR of all elements in that subarray.

- The maximum XOR score of a subarray of odd length within [i, j], which is the XOR of the first and last elements of that subarray.

But this is not necessarily true. For example, in the first example, the maximum for the subarray [0,2] is 12, which comes from the even-length subarray [8,4], which has XOR 12. But there's also a subarray of odd length [8,4] (length 2, which is even). So this doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum XOR score for a subarray [i, j] is the maximum between:

- The maximum XOR score of any even-length subarray within [i, j], which is the maximum XOR of all elements in any even-length subarray.

- The maximum XOR score of any odd-length subarray within [i, j], which is the maximum XOR of the first and last elements of any odd-length subarray.

But again, this is not necessarily true.

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a way to precompute for all possible subarrays their XOR score and then use a 2D RMQ to answer the queries.

But how to compute the XOR score for all subarrays efficiently.

Let's think about the XOR reduction process again. For a subarray of length m, the final XOR is the result of applying m-1 XOR operations. Each step reduces the array size by 1.

But perhaps there's a way to model this using a dynamic programming approach. For example, for each possible subarray [i, j], we can compute the XOR score by combining the results of smaller subarrays.

But I'm not sure how.

Another idea: The XOR reduction process for a subarray [i, j] can be viewed as follows:

The first step produces a new array of length m-1, where each element is the XOR of adjacent pairs. The last element is removed.

The second step produces an array of length m-2, and so on.

The final result is the only element left.

But this is similar to building a binary tree, where each level is the XOR of adjacent pairs. The root is the final result.

But how to model this for all possible subarrays.

Alternatively, perhaps the final result can be computed using a sliding window approach. For example, for a subarray of length m, the final result is the XOR of the elements at positions i, i+2, i+4, etc., up to j if m is odd, or up to j-1 if m is even. But this is just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the final result is the XOR of the elements at positions i and j, then i+1 and j-1, and so on. For example, for m=5 (i=0, j=4):

XOR 0 and 4 → x.

XOR 1 and 3 → y.

XOR x and y → x^y = 0^4^1^3.

But in the example, the result was 0^4. So this is not matching.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think I need to find a different approach.

Let's think about the problem differently. For each query, we need to find the maximum XOR score of any subarray within [l, r]. The XOR score for a subarray [a, b] is the result of the reduction process.

But the reduction process for [a, b] can be represented as a binary tree. The leaves are the elements of the subarray, and each internal node is the XOR of its two children. The root is the final result.

The problem is to find the maximum root value over all possible subarrays [a, b] within [l, r].

But how to compute this efficiently.

Another idea: The maximum XOR score for a subarray [a, b] is the maximum of all possible XOR combinations of elements in the subarray, but this is not necessarily true.

Alternatively, the maximum XOR score is the maximum possible XOR of any subset of elements in the subarray, but this is also not necessarily true.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think I need to look for a different approach.

Let's think about the problem constraints. The array size is up to 2000, and the number of queries is up to 1e5. So any O(n^2) pre-processing is acceptable, but O(n^3) is not.

So the plan is:

1. Precompute for all possible subarrays [i, j] their XOR score.

2. Build a 2D RMQ structure to answer the maximum in a rectangle [l, r] x [l, r].

3. For each query, return the maximum value in the precomputed matrix for the rectangle [l, r].

The key is step 1: how to compute the XOR score for all [i, j] in O(n^2) time.

But how?

Let's think about the XOR reduction process for a subarray [i, j]. The process is to repeatedly XOR adjacent elements and remove the last element each time. The final result is the XOR of the elements in a certain way.

But perhaps there's a way to compute this using dynamic programming. For example, for each possible subarray [i, j], we can compute the XOR score based on smaller subarrays.

Let's define a 2D array dp[i][j] as the XOR score of the subarray [i, j].

For the base case, when i == j, dp[i][j] = nums[i].

For i < j:

The XOR score of [i, j] can be computed as the XOR of the first element and the XOR score of the subarray [i+1, j], but this is not correct.

Alternatively, the XOR score of [i, j] is the XOR of the first element and the XOR score of the subarray [i+1, j-1], but this is also not correct.

Alternatively, the XOR score of [i, j] is the XOR of the first element and the XOR score of the subarray [i+1, j], but this is not correct.

This approach doesn't seem to work.

Another idea: The XOR reduction process for [i, j] can be viewed as follows:

The first step produces a new array of length m-1, where each element is the XOR of adjacent pairs. The last element is removed.

The second step produces an array of length m-2, and so on.

The final result is the only element left.

But this is similar to building a binary tree, and the final result is the XOR of the leaves in a certain order.

But how to model this for all possible subarrays.

Alternatively, perhaps the final result can be computed using a sliding window approach. For example, for a subarray of length m, the final result is the XOR of the elements at even indices. But this is not supported by the examples.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think I need to look for a different approach.

Let's think about the problem from the perspective of the example given in the first case.

In the first example, the maximum XOR score for the subarray [0,2] is 12, which comes from the subarray [8,4] (even length). The XOR score is 8^4=12.

For the subarray [1,4], the maximum is 60, which comes from the entire subarray (even length). The XOR score is 8^4^32^16=60.

For the subarray [0,5], the maximum is 60, which comes from the same subarray as in the previous query.

So the maximum can come from even-length subarrays.

But how to find the maximum for all possible subarrays.

Another observation: For even-length subarrays, the XOR score is the XOR of all elements. For odd-length subarrays, the XOR score is the XOR of the first and last elements, then the next first and next last, etc. But this is not confirmed.

But if this is the case, then for even-length subarrays, the XOR score is the XOR of all elements, and for odd-length subarrays, the XOR score is the XOR of the first and last elements.

But in the first example, the subarray [8,4] (even length) has XOR 12, which is 8^4. The subarray [8,4,32,16] (even length) has XOR 8^4^32^16=60.

For the subarray [2,8,4] (odd length), the maximum is 12, which comes from the even-length subarray [8,4].

So the maximum for a query can come from even or odd-length subarrays.

But if the XOR score for even-length subarrays is the XOR of all elements, and for odd-length subarrays is the XOR of the first and last elements, then the maximum for a query is the maximum between the maximum XOR of all even-length subarrays and the maximum XOR of all possible first and last elements of odd-length subarrays.

But how to compute this.

If this is the case, then for each query [l, r], the answer is the maximum of:

- The maximum XOR of any even-length subarray within [l, r], which is the maximum XOR of all elements in any even-length subarray.

- The maximum XOR of any two elements in the subarray, where the two elements are the first and last of an odd-length subarray.

But this is not necessarily correct. For example, in the first example, the maximum for the subarray [0,2] is 12, which is the XOR of 8 and 4 (even-length subarray). But there's also an odd-length subarray [8,4] (length 2, which is even). So this doesn't fit.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think I need to look for a different approach.

Let's think about the problem in terms of the XOR reduction process. For a subarray of even length, the final XOR is the XOR of all elements. For a subarray of odd length, the final XOR is the XOR of the first and last elements. If this is true, then the problem becomes manageable.

Assuming this is the case, then for each query [l, r], the maximum XOR score is the maximum between:

- The maximum XOR of any even-length subarray within [l, r], which is the maximum XOR of all elements in any even-length subarray.

- The maximum XOR of any two elements in the subarray, where the two elements are the first and last of an odd-length subarray.

But how to compute this.

For even-length subarrays, the maximum XOR is the maximum XOR of any contiguous subarray of even length. For example, for a subarray of length 2, it's the XOR of the two elements. For length 4, it's the XOR of all four elements. So the maximum for even-length subarrays is the maximum XOR of all possible even-length subarrays.

For odd-length subarrays, the maximum is the maximum XOR of any two elements in the subarray, where the two elements are the first and last of the subarray. For example, for a subarray of length 3, the maximum is the XOR of the first and third elements. For length 5, the maximum is the XOR of the first and fifth elements.

So the maximum for a query is the maximum between the maximum even-length subarray XOR and the maximum pair of elements (i, j) where i <= j and j - i + 1 is odd.

But how to compute this.

For even-length subarrays, the maximum XOR is the maximum of all possible even-length subarrays' XOR of all elements. For example, for a subarray of length 2, it's a[i]^a[i+1]. For length 4, it's a[i]^a[i+1]^a[i+2]^a[i+3], etc.

For odd-length subarrays, the maximum is the maximum of a[i]^a[j] for all i <= j where j - i + 1 is odd.

So the problem reduces to two parts:

1. For each query [l, r], compute the maximum XOR of any even-length subarray within [l, r].

2. Compute the maximum XOR of any pair of elements (i, j) within [l, r] where j - i + 1 is odd.

The answer for the query is the maximum between these two values.

If this is the case, then the problem becomes manageable.

But how to compute these two values efficiently.

For part 2, the maximum XOR of pairs (i, j) where j - i + 1 is odd can be computed using a 2D RMQ structure for the maximum XOR of pairs. But since the pairs must have an odd length, which is equivalent to j - i being even (since j - i + 1 is odd → j - i is even), we can precompute for each possible (i, j) where j - i is even, the XOR of a[i] and a[j], and build a 2D RMQ structure for this.

For part 1, the maximum XOR of even-length subarrays is the maximum of all possible even-length subarrays' XOR of all elements. For even-length subarrays, the XOR is the XOR of all elements in the subarray. So for each even-length subarray [i, j], compute the XOR of a[i]^a[i+1]^...^a[j], and track the maximum.

But how to compute this efficiently.

For part 1, we can precompute a prefix XOR array. Let's define prefix_xor[0] = 0, and prefix_xor[i] = prefix_xor[i-1] ^ a[i-1]. Then, the XOR of a subarray [i, j] is prefix_xor[j+1] ^ prefix_xor[i].

For even-length subarrays, the XOR is prefix_xor[j+1] ^ prefix_xor[i]. So for each even-length subarray [i, j], compute this value and track the maximum.

But how to find the maximum for all even-length subarrays within [l, r].

Similarly, for part 2, the maximum XOR of pairs (i, j) where j - i is even can be found by precomputing a 2D array where each entry (i, j) is a[i]^a[j] if j - i is even, and -infinity otherwise. Then, build a 2D RMQ structure for this array.

Once these two structures are built, each query can be answered by finding the maximum in the even-length subarrays' RMQ and the pairs' RMQ, and taking the maximum of the two.

But how to build these structures.

For part 1, the even-length subarrays' maximum can be found using a 2D RMQ structure that stores the maximum XOR for even-length subarrays. But this would require O(n^2) space and O(n^2 log n) preprocessing time, which is manageable for n=2000.

For part 2, the pairs' maximum can be found using a 2D RMQ structure that stores the maximum a[i]^a[j] for pairs (i, j) where j - i is even. This would also require O(n^2) space and O(n^2 log n) preprocessing time.

But with n=2000, the 2D RMQ structures would require 4e6 entries, which is manageable.

Once these structures are built, each query can be answered in O(1) time.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute the prefix_xor array.

2. Precompute a 2D array even_max_xor where even_max_xor[i][j] is the maximum XOR of even-length subarrays within [i, j].

3. Precompute a 2D array pair_max_xor where pair_max_xor[i][j] is the maximum a[i]^a[j] for pairs (i, j) where j - i is even and i <= j.

4. Build 2D RMQ structures for even_max_xor and pair_max_xor.

5. For each query [l, r], compute the maximum between even_max_xor.query(l, r) and pair_max_xor.query(l, r), and return the maximum.

But how to compute even_max_xor and pair_max_xor.

For even_max_xor:

even_max_xor[i][j] is the maximum XOR of all even-length subarrays within [i, j]. For each even-length subarray [a, b] where i <= a <= b <= j and (b - a + 1) is even, compute the XOR and track the maximum.

But how to compute this efficiently.

We can precompute a 2D array even_max_xor where even_max_xor[i][j] is the maximum XOR of even-length subarrays within [i, j]. This can be computed using dynamic programming:

even_max_xor[i][j] = max(even_max_xor[i][j-1], even_max_xor[i+1][j], xor_even(i, j))

where xor_even(i, j) is the XOR of the subarray [i, j] if (j - i + 1) is even, otherwise -infinity.

But this would take O(n^2) time.

Alternatively, for each possible even-length subarray [i, j], compute its XOR and update the even_max_xor[i][j] accordingly.

But this would take O(n^2) time.

For example, for each i from 0 to n-1:

   for j from i to n-1:

       if (j - i + 1) is even:

           current_xor = prefix_xor[j+1] ^ prefix_xor[i]

           if current_xor > even_max_xor[i][j]:

               even_max_xor[i][j] = current_xor

       even_max_xor[i][j] = max(even_max_xor[i][j], even_max_xor[i][j-1], even_max_xor[i+1][j])

But this is not correct, as the even_max_xor[i][j] depends on smaller subarrays.

Alternatively, we can precompute even_max_xor[i][j] as the maximum of all even-length subarrays within [i, j]. This can be done using a 2D RMQ structure for the XOR of even-length subarrays.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for even_max_xor, we can precompute for each possible [i, j] the maximum XOR of even-length subarrays within [i, j]. This can be done using a nested loop:

Initialize even_max_xor as a 2D array filled with -infinity.

For each possible even-length subarray [a, b] (where b - a + 1 is even):

   compute xor_val = prefix_xor[b+1] ^ prefix_xor[a]

   for all i <= a and j >= b:

       even_max_xor[i][j] = max(even_max_xor[i][j], xor_val)

But this would take O(n^4) time, which is not feasible.

So this approach is not feasible.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think I need to find a different way to model the problem.

Another idea: The maximum XOR score for a subarray [a, b] is the maximum between:

- The maximum XOR of any even-length subarray within [a, b].

- The maximum XOR of any pair of elements (i, j) where j - i is even.

So for each query [l, r], the answer is the maximum of these two values.

If this is the case, then the problem can be split into two parts:

1. Find the maximum XOR of any even-length subarray within [l, r].

2. Find the maximum XOR of any pair of elements (i, j) within [l, r] where j - i is even.

The answer is the maximum of these two values.

So how to compute these two values efficiently.

For part 1, the maximum XOR of even-length subarrays can be found by precomputing a 2D RMQ structure for the XOR of even-length subarrays. For each even-length subarray [i, j], compute its XOR and store it in a matrix. Then, build a 2D RMQ structure to answer the maximum in a rectangle.

For part 2, the maximum XOR of pairs (i, j) where j - i is even can be found by precomputing a 2D RMQ structure for the maximum a[i]^a[j] for all pairs (i, j) where j - i is even.

But how to build these structures.

For part 1:

We can precompute a matrix even_xor where even_xor[i][j] is the XOR of the subarray [i, j] if (j - i + 1) is even, otherwise -infinity. Then, build a 2D RMQ structure for this matrix.

For part 2:

We can precompute a matrix pair_xor where pair_xor[i][j] is a[i]^a[j] if (j - i) is even, otherwise -infinity. Then, build a 2D RMQ structure for this matrix.

Once these structures are built, each query can be answered by querying both structures and taking the maximum.

But how to compute the even_xor matrix.

The even_xor matrix can be computed using the prefix_xor array. For each i and j, if (j - i + 1) is even, even_xor[i][j] = prefix_xor[j+1] ^ prefix_xor[i]. Otherwise, even_xor[i][j] = -infinity.

This can be computed in O(n^2) time.

Similarly, the pair_xor matrix can be computed in O(n^2) time.

Once these matrices are computed, building the 2D RMQ structures is the next step.

But building a 2D RMQ structure for O(n^2) entries is possible. The query time is O(1) for each query.

So the steps are:

1. Compute the prefix_xor array.

2. Compute the even_xor matrix.

3. Compute the pair_xor matrix.

4. Build 2D RMQ structures for even_xor and pair_xor.

5. For each query [l, r], compute the maximum in even_xor[l][r] and pair_xor[l][r], and return the maximum of the two.

But wait, the even_xor matrix contains the XOR of even-length subarrays. So the maximum even-length subarray XOR in [l, r] is the maximum value in even_xor[i][j] for all i >= l, j <= r, and (j - i + 1) is even.

But the 2D RMQ structure for even_xor would allow us to query the maximum in the rectangle [l, r] x [l, r], but we need to consider only even-length subarrays. However, the even_xor matrix already contains -infinity for odd-length subarrays, so the maximum in the rectangle would automatically ignore them.

Similarly, the pair_xor matrix contains a[i]^a[j] for pairs (i, j) where j - i is even. So the maximum in the rectangle [l, r] x [l, r] would give the maximum XOR of such pairs.

So the answer for the query is the maximum between the two RMQ queries.

This approach should work.

Now, let's test this with the first example.

Example 1:

nums = [2,8,4,32,16,1]

prefix_xor is [0, 2, 10, 14, 46, 62, 63]

even_xor matrix:

For i=0, j=1: even length 2 → XOR is 2^8=10.

i=0, j=3: even length 4 → XOR is 2^8^4^32=46.

i=1, j=2: even length 2 → 8^4=12.

i=1, j=4: even length 4 → 8^4^32^16=60.

i=2, j=3: even length 2 →4^32=36.

i=2, j=5: even length 4 →4^32^16^1=51.

i=3, j=4: even length 2 →32^16=48.

i=3, j=5: even length 3 → no, it's odd.

i=4, j=5: even length 2 →16^1=17.

So the even_xor matrix for even-length subarrays would have these values.

The pair_xor matrix would have a[i]^a[j] for pairs where j - i is even.

For example, i=0, j=2: j - i = 2 (even) → 2^4=6.

i=0, j=4: 2^16=18.

i=1, j=3: 8^32=40.

i=1, j=5: 8^1=9.

i=2, j=4:4^16=20.

i=2, j=6: out of bounds.

So for the first query [0,2], the even_xor matrix would have the maximum even-length subarray XOR as 12 (from i=1, j=2). The pair_xor matrix would have the maximum pair XOR as 2^4=6 (i=0, j=2). So the maximum is 12.

For the second query [1,4], the even_xor matrix's maximum is 60 (i=1, j=4). The pair_xor matrix's maximum is 8^32=40 (i=1, j=3). So the maximum is 60.

For the third query [0,5], the even_xor matrix's maximum is 60 (i=1, j=4). The pair_xor matrix's maximum is 8^32=40. So the maximum is 60.

This matches the example.

So this approach seems to work.

Now, let's test the second example.

Example 2:

nums = [0,7,3,2,8,5,1]

queries = [[0,3],[1,5],[2,4],[2,6],[5,6]]

For the first query [0,3], the even_xor matrix would have even-length subarrays:

[0,1] → 0^7=7.

[0,3] → 0^7^3^2=
