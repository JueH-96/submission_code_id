Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of connected components in a graph formed by nodes with values from the nums array. The edges exist between nodes i and j if their LCM is <= threshold. Hmm, the constraints are tight, especially since nums can be up to 1e5 elements. So I need an efficient way to compute this.

First, let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to check every pair of nodes and see if they are connected, then build the graph and find connected components. But with n=1e5, that's O(n^2) which is impossible. So that's not feasible. Need a smarter approach.

Wait, the key is to find which numbers can be in the same component. So maybe group numbers that are factors of each other or have some relation that allows their LCM to be <= threshold. But how?

Let me think about the LCM condition. The LCM of two numbers a and b is (a*b)/gcd(a,b). So for LCM(a,b) <= threshold, a*b / gcd(a,b) <= threshold. But how can I efficiently find all pairs that satisfy this?

Alternatively, for a given number a, which other numbers b can form an edge with it? The condition is LCM(a,b) <= threshold. Let's rearrange this. Since LCM(a,b) = (a*b)/gcd(a,b), then a*b <= threshold * gcd(a,b). But I'm not sure how to use this.

Another angle: For two numbers to be in the same component, there must be a path between them where each step's LCM is <= threshold. So maybe the connected components are determined by some equivalence relation. But what's the equivalence here?

Wait, maybe if a and b are connected directly, and b and c are connected directly, then a and c are in the same component. But how to model this.

Alternatively, think of the problem as building a graph where edges are between numbers that can be "linked" via some factors. But again, how to model this efficiently.

Let me look at the examples. In example 1, nums = [2,4,8,3,9], threshold=5. The connected components are (2,4), (3), (8), (9). Let's see why:

- LCM(2,4) is 4 <=5. So they are connected. 4 and 8: LCM is 8, which is >5. So 4 and 8 are not directly connected. So 2 and 4 form a component. 8 is alone. 3 and 9: LCM(3,9) is 9>5, so they are separate. So each is a component.

In example 2, threshold is 10. The components are (2,3,4,8,9) and 12. Let's see:

- 2 and 3: LCM is 6 <=10. So connected. 3 and 4: LCM is 12>10. Wait, but how are they in the same component? Oh, maybe via other nodes. Like 2 and 4 (LCM 4), 2 and 3 (6), 3 and 8 (LCM 24>10?), wait no. Wait, maybe the example explanation is wrong. Wait, the example says the components are (2,3,4,8,9). Let me check:

Wait, 2 and 4: LCM 4 <=10. So connected. 4 and 8: LCM 8 <=10. So connected. So 2,4,8 are in the same component. Then 2 and 3: LCM 6 <=10. So 3 is connected to 2, hence part of the same component. 3 and 9: LCM 9 <=10? No, 9 is 9 which is <=10. So 3 and 9 are connected. So all these are in the same component. So 2,3,4,8,9 form a component. 12 is alone.

So the key is that even if two numbers are not directly connected, they can be part of the same component via other nodes.

So the problem is to model the connected components where any two nodes in the component are connected via a path where each step's LCM is <= threshold.

But how to compute this efficiently for large n?

Hmm. Let's think of the numbers in terms of their factors. Maybe group numbers by their divisors. But I'm not sure.

Alternative approach: For each number, find all other numbers that are divisors of it, or multiples, but within the threshold. But again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the connected components can be determined by the set of numbers that share a common divisor that allows their LCM to be within the threshold. But how?

Alternatively, think of the problem as building a graph where edges are between numbers a and b if LCM(a,b) <= threshold. Then, the connected components are the groups of numbers connected via these edges. But building this graph explicitly is impossible for n=1e5.

So we need a way to model the connected components without explicitly checking all pairs.

Another idea: For each number a, find all numbers b where LCM(a, b) <= threshold. Then, the connected components are the equivalence classes under the transitive closure of this relation. But how to compute this efficiently.

Wait, but even if a and b are not directly connected, they might be connected via a chain. For example, a and c are connected, c and d are connected, etc., leading to a and d being in the same component.

So the problem is similar to finding connected components in a graph where edges are defined by the LCM condition, but the graph is not explicitly built.

This seems challenging. Let's think of possible optimizations.

First, note that if a and b are in the same component, then all numbers in their component must have LCM with a or b that is <= threshold. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the connected components can be determined by the set of numbers that are in the same "family" based on their factors. For example, if a number x is a multiple of another number y, and x is small enough such that LCM(x, y) = x <= threshold, then x and y are connected. But this is only a part of the possible edges.

Wait, let's think: LCM(a, b) <= threshold. So for a and b to be connected directly, their LCM must be <= threshold. But even if they are not directly connected, they can be part of the same component via other nodes.

But how to model this.

Alternative approach: For each number, find the minimal number in its component. Then, group numbers by their minimal elements. But how to find the minimal elements.

Alternatively, think of the problem as building a union-find (disjoint set) structure. For each number, we can find all numbers that are connected to it (directly or indirectly) and merge their sets. But again, the problem is how to find the connected numbers efficiently.

But with n=1e5, even O(n log n) is acceptable, but O(n^2) is not.

So the key is to find a way to process the numbers in a way that allows us to group them into connected components efficiently.

Let me think of the following approach:

1. Sort the array in ascending order. Because smaller numbers are more likely to have LCM with others that is small.

2. For each number a in the sorted list, check all previous numbers (smaller than a) to see if LCM(a, b) <= threshold. If yes, then merge their sets in the union-find structure.

But even this approach could be O(n^2) in the worst case. For example, if all numbers are 1, then each new number would have to check all previous ones, leading to O(n^2) time.

But given the constraints, this is not feasible. So this approach is not suitable.

Alternative idea: For each number a, find all numbers b where b divides a, and a / b <= threshold. Because LCM(a, b) is a if b divides a. So if a is divisible by b, then LCM(a, b) = a. So if a <= threshold, then a and b can be connected. But this is only a subset of possible edges.

Wait, but if a and b are such that LCM(a, b) <= threshold, then they can be connected. So for a given a, the numbers that can be connected to it directly are those where LCM(a, b) <= threshold.

But how to find those numbers efficiently.

Another thought: For each a, the numbers that can be connected to a are those that are factors of a (if a <= threshold) or multiples of a (if the multiple is <= threshold). But this is not necessarily true. For example, a=2, threshold=5. Then numbers like 3 can be connected to 2 if LCM(2,3)=6>5. So no. But if threshold is 6, then LCM(2,3)=6 is allowed.

Hmm. So perhaps the key is to find for each a, all numbers b where LCM(a, b) <= threshold. But how to compute this efficiently.

Let me think of the LCM condition. LCM(a, b) = (a*b)/gcd(a,b) <= threshold. So a*b <= threshold * gcd(a,b). But since gcd(a,b) divides both a and b, perhaps we can find some way to represent this.

Alternatively, for a given a, the maximum possible b that can form an edge with a is when LCM(a, b) is <= threshold. So for each a, the possible b's are those where b <= (threshold * gcd(a, b)) / a. But this seems circular.

Alternatively, for a given a, the possible b's must satisfy that (a*b) / gcd(a,b) <= threshold. Let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then a = d * x, b = d * y, where x and y are coprime. Then LCM(a, b) = d * x * y. So the condition becomes d * x * y <= threshold. Since x and y are coprime, and a = d*x, b = d*y.

So for a given a, which is d*x, we can look for numbers b = d*y where y is coprime with x, and d*x*y <= threshold. But how to find such y's.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Another approach: For each number a, find all numbers b such that b is a divisor of a * k, where k is some factor. Not sure.

Alternatively, for each a, the numbers that can be connected to it are those that are in the set {x | LCM(a, x) <= threshold}. So for each a, we need to find all x in nums where LCM(a, x) <= threshold.

But how to compute this efficiently.

If the array is sorted, perhaps for each a, we can find the maximum x such that LCM(a, x) <= threshold, and then all x's up to that maximum can be considered. But even that is not straightforward.

Wait, but if the array is sorted, for a given a, the possible x's that can form an edge with a are those where LCM(a, x) <= threshold. Let's think of x in sorted order. For example, if a is 2 and threshold is 5, then x can be 2 (LCM 2), 4 (LCM 4), 3 (LCM 6>5, so no). So in the sorted array, for a=2, the x's that are allowed are those where LCM(2, x) <=5. So x can be 2,4. But 3 is not allowed. So how to find these x's.

But even if the array is sorted, for each a, how to find all x's in the array that satisfy LCM(a, x) <= threshold.

This seems challenging. Let's think of the following steps:

1. Sort the array in ascending order.

2. For each a in the array, iterate through the array and find all x's that are <= (threshold * gcd(a, x)) / a. But this is not helpful.

Alternatively, for each a, the maximum x that can form an edge with a is when LCM(a, x) is as small as possible. For example, if a is 2 and threshold is 5, then x can be up to 4 (since LCM(2,4)=4 <=5). But x=3 would have LCM 6>5.

But how to find x's in the array that are <= threshold and have LCM with a <= threshold.

Wait, but even if x is larger than a, but their LCM is <= threshold, they can be connected. For example, a=3, x=2, threshold=6. LCM is 6 <=6. So they can be connected.

So sorting the array may not directly help, but perhaps processing in a certain order can.

Alternative idea: For each a, find all x in the array where x <= threshold and a divides x (so LCM is x). Then, x can be connected to a. But this is only a subset of possible edges.

But even this, how to find x's that are multiples of a and <= threshold.

But if a is larger than threshold, then x can't be a multiple of a (since x >=a, so x would be >=a>threshold, but x must be <= threshold). So in that case, a can't form any edges with x's that are multiples of a.

Hmm. So perhaps for each a, the x's that can be connected to it are:

- x's that are divisors of a, and a <= threshold.

- x's that are multiples of a, and x <= threshold.

- x's that are co-prime with a, and a*x <= threshold.

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, for each a, the x's that can form an edge with a are those where x <= threshold and a <= threshold, and LCM(a, x) <= threshold.

But how to compute this.

Another approach: For each a, the maximum possible x that can form an edge with a is when LCM(a, x) is as small as possible. Let's think of x in terms of factors of a.

Wait, perhaps the key is to precompute for each a, the set of numbers in the array that are divisors of a, and a <= threshold. Then, those numbers can be connected to a. Similarly, for multiples of a that are <= threshold.

But even this, how to find those numbers efficiently.

Alternatively, for each a, we can find all x in the array where x divides a and a <= threshold. Then, x and a can be connected. Similarly, if a divides x and x <= threshold, then a and x can be connected.

But this is only a subset of possible edges. For example, a=2, x=3, threshold=6. LCM is 6, which is allowed. But neither divides the other.

So this approach would miss such pairs.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is more complex than that.

Let me think of the union-find approach again. The idea is to process the numbers in some order and for each number, find all numbers that can be connected to it (either directly or via existing connections) and merge their sets.

But how to find those numbers efficiently.

Wait, perhaps the key is to process the numbers in increasing order. For each number a, check all numbers that are factors of a and are <= threshold. Then, merge a's set with those numbers. Also, check if a is a multiple of any existing numbers (but that's already covered if we process in increasing order).

Wait, here's an idea:

Sort the array in increasing order. For each a in the sorted array:

- Check all divisors d of a where d is present in the array and d <= threshold. For each such d, merge a's set with d's set.

- Also, check if a is <= threshold. Then, any number x in the array that is a divisor of a (so x divides a) and x <= threshold can be merged with a. But since the array is sorted, x would have been processed before a. So when processing a, we can check all x's that are divisors of a and are present in the array (and x <= threshold) and merge them.

But how to find the divisors of a that are present in the array.

But for a number a, the number of divisors is O(sqrt(a)), which is manageable if a is up to 1e9. But for 1e5 numbers, each with up to 1e3 divisors (for a=1e9, sqrt(a) is 3e4), this could be 1e5 * 3e4 = 3e9 operations, which is way too much.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: For each a, find all primes and their exponents, but that's not helpful.

Hmm. Let's think differently. Let's precompute a map from each number to its divisors. But even that is not feasible for 1e5 numbers.

Alternative approach: For each a in the sorted array, check if there exists a number in the array that is a divisor of a and <= threshold. If so, merge them. Also, check if a is a multiple of any existing numbers (but again, how?).

Alternatively, for each a, check if a is <= threshold. Then, any number x in the array that is a divisor of a (x divides a) can be merged with a. But how to find x's that are divisors of a and present in the array.

But even this, for each a, finding all divisors in the array is O(d(a)), which could be expensive.

But perhaps, given that the array is sorted, we can use a hash set to check if a divisor exists.

So here's a possible approach:

1. Sort the array in increasing order.

2. Create a hash set of the numbers for O(1) lookups.

3. For each a in the sorted array:

   a. If a > threshold, then it can't form any edges with numbers larger than it (since they are sorted). But maybe with smaller numbers. Wait, but a is larger than threshold. So for any x < a, LCM(a, x) could be a * x / gcd(a, x). Since a > threshold, and x <= a, then a * x >= a * 1 = a > threshold. So LCM(a, x) would be >= a * x / a = x. But if a > threshold, then x could be <= threshold, but LCM(a, x) could be larger than threshold. For example, a=6, threshold=5, x=3. LCM is 6>5. So a=6 can't form any edges with x=3. So if a > threshold, then a can't form any edges with any x in the array. Because for any x <= a, LCM(a, x) >= x. If x <= threshold, but a > threshold, then LCM(a, x) could be a * x / gcd(a, x). For example, a=6, x=2: LCM is 6>5. So a=6 can't form any edges. So if a > threshold, then a is a separate component.

   So, for a > threshold, we can immediately add it as a separate component, and move on.

   So the first step is to process all a in the array. For a > threshold, they are their own components.

   For a <= threshold:

   - Find all divisors of a that are present in the array. For each such divisor d, merge a's set with d's set.

   - Also, find all multiples of a that are present in the array and <= threshold. For each such multiple m, merge a's set with m's set.

   Wait, but if a is 2 and threshold is 5, then multiples of 2 in the array that are <=5 are 4. So 2 and 4 are merged.

   But how to find multiples of a in the array that are <= threshold.

   For example, a=2, threshold=5. The multiples are 2,4. So in the array, if 4 is present, merge.

   So for a given a, the multiples are a*1, a*2, ... up to threshold.

   So for a, the maximum multiple is floor(threshold / a) * a.

   So for a=2, threshold=5: floor(5/2) = 2, so multiples are 2,4.

   So for each a, the possible multiples are a * k where k is 1, 2, ... up to floor(threshold /a).

   So for each a, we can generate all possible multiples m = a * k, where m <= threshold, and check if m is present in the array.

   If m is present, then merge a and m.

   But how to check if m is present in the array. We can use a hash set for O(1) lookups.

   So the steps for a <= threshold:

   - Generate all divisors of a (excluding a itself?), and check if they are present in the array. For each such d, merge a and d.

   - Generate all multiples of a (a*1, a*2, ...) up to threshold, and check if they are present in the array. For each such m, merge a and m.

   But this approach would cover all possible edges where a and d are connected via LCM(a, d) <= threshold. Because:

   - If d is a divisor of a, then LCM(a, d) = a. So if a <= threshold, then LCM(a, d) = a <= threshold. So they are connected.

   - If m is a multiple of a, then LCM(a, m) = m. So if m <= threshold, then LCM(a, m) = m <= threshold. So they are connected.

   But what about cases where a and b are not divisors or multiples, but their LCM is <= threshold. For example, a=2, b=3, threshold=6. LCM is 6 <=6. So they should be connected. But according to the above approach, since 3 is not a divisor of 2, and 2 is not a multiple of 3, they would not be merged. So this approach would miss such cases.

   So this approach is not sufficient. It only considers edges where one is a divisor or multiple of the other, but not other cases.

   So this approach would not work for the example where a=2 and b=3 with threshold=6. They should be connected, but according to the approach, they are not.

   So this approach is incorrect.

   Hmm. So this suggests that the approach of considering only divisors and multiples is insufficient.

   So what's the alternative?

   Let's think again. The problem is that even if two numbers are not divisors or multiples of each other, their LCM could still be <= threshold. For example, 2 and 3 with threshold 6.

   So how to handle such cases.

   So the previous approach would miss these edges, leading to incorrect connected components.

   So we need a way to find all pairs (a, b) where LCM(a, b) <= threshold, but without checking all pairs.

   This seems challenging.

   Let's think of the following:

   For each a in the array (sorted), we can find all b in the array where LCM(a, b) <= threshold. But how?

   The LCM condition is (a*b)/gcd(a,b) <= threshold. Let's rearrange this as a*b <= threshold * gcd(a, b).

   But since gcd(a, b) divides both a and b, perhaps we can find some way to represent this.

   Let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then a = d * x, b = d * y, where x and y are coprime. Then the condition becomes d^2 * x * y <= threshold * d → d * x * y <= threshold.

   So for a given a (which is d*x), we need to find all b (d*y) such that d*y is in the array, x and y are coprime, and d*x*y <= threshold.

   But how to find such y's.

   This seems complicated. But perhaps for each a, we can iterate over possible d's (divisors of a) and find possible y's.

   For example, for a=6 (d=6, x=1), then d*x*y =6*1*y <= threshold. So y can be up to threshold/(6*1). But y must be coprime with x=1, which is always true. So for a=6, any multiple of 6 (d=6) would have y=1, but that's the same as a. So this approach may not help.

   Alternatively, for a=2 (d=1, x=2), then d*x*y =1*2*y <= threshold. So 2y <= threshold. So y can be up to threshold//2. And y must be coprime with x=2. So y must be odd. So for a=2, threshold=6, y can be 1,3. So possible b's are d*y =1*1*1=1 (if present), 1*3*1=3 (if present). So if the array has 1 and 3, then a=2 can connect to them.

   But this approach requires for each a, to find all possible d's (divisors of a), then for each d, find y's such that d*x*y <= threshold, where x = a/d, and y is coprime with x.

   This seems computationally expensive, but perhaps manageable.

   Let's outline the steps:

   1. Sort the array in increasing order.

   2. Create a hash set for O(1) lookups.

   3. For each a in the sorted array:

      a. If a > threshold: add to the count as a separate component. Continue.

      b. Else:

         i. For each divisor d of a:

             - Compute x = a/d.

             - The condition is d * x * y <= threshold → y <= threshold/(d*x).

             - Since x and y must be coprime, we need to find all y's in the array that are multiples of d (since b = d*y) and y is coprime with x.

             - For each possible y in the array where y is a multiple of d, and y <= threshold/(d*x), and gcd(x, y/d) == 1 (since y = d * y', and x and y' must be coprime).

             - For each such y, merge a and y.

         ii. Also, check for multiples of a (as before), but this may not be necessary since the divisor approach may cover it.

   But this approach is still not clear. How to find the divisors d of a, and then find y's that are multiples of d, and meet the conditions.

   This seems very complex and possibly not feasible for large a.

   Another idea: For each a, iterate through all possible d (divisors of a), then for each d, compute the maximum possible y such that d*x*y <= threshold. Then, check if there are any numbers in the array that are multiples of d and equal to d*y, where y is coprime with x.

   But this is getting too complicated.

   Let's think of the example where a=2 and threshold=6. The possible pairs are (2,3) with LCM 6. So how would this be captured?

   For a=2, d can be 1 or 2.

   For d=1: x=2. The condition is 1*2*y <=6 → y <=3. y must be coprime with 2. So y can be 1,3. So possible b's are 1*1=1 (if present) and 1*3=3 (if present). So if 3 is present, then a=2 and 3 are merged.

   For d=2: x=1. The condition is 2*1*y <=6 → y <=3. y must be coprime with 1 (which is always true). So possible y's are 1,2,3. So possible b's are 2*1=2 (a itself), 2*2=4 (if present), 2*3=6 (if present). So if 4 is present, a=2 and 4 are merged. If 6 is present, a=2 and 6 are merged.

   So in this case, for a=2, the code would check for d=1 and d=2, and find possible y's. For d=1, y=3 is allowed, so if 3 is present, merge. For d=2, y=2 (a itself) is allowed, but that's the same node. So this approach would capture the (2,3) pair.

   So this approach could work. But how to implement it efficiently.

   The steps would be:

   For each a in the sorted array:

   - If a > threshold: add to count as a separate component.

   - Else:

      For each divisor d of a:

         x = a/d

         max_y = threshold // (d * x)

         if max_y < 1: continue

         Now, we need to find all numbers b in the array where:

            b is a multiple of d (since b = d * y)

            y <= max_y

            gcd(x, y) == 1 (since y must be coprime with x)

         For each such b, merge a and b.

   But how to find such b's efficiently.

   For each d, we can generate all possible y's up to max_y, and check if d*y is present in the array. But for large max_y, this is not feasible.

   For example, if a=1, threshold=2e5. Then d=1, x=1. max_y=2e5. So y can be up to 2e5, and we need to check if d*y is present in the array. But this would require checking 2e5 possible y's, which is O(2e5) per a. For n=1e5, this is 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.

   So this approach is not feasible.

   Hmm. So this suggests that the problem requires a different approach.

   Let's think of the problem in terms of the connected components. Each component is a set of numbers where any two numbers in the set can be connected via a path where each step's LCM is <= threshold.

   So the connected components are determined by the transitive closure of the LCM condition.

   But how to model this.

   Another idea: The connected components are determined by the set of numbers that share a common divisor that is <= threshold. But this is not necessarily true. For example, 2 and 3 have LCM 6, which is <= threshold=6. But their GCD is 1, which is <=6. So perhaps the connected components are determined by the GCD of all numbers in the component.

   But I'm not sure.

   Alternatively, think of the problem as a graph where edges are between numbers a and b if LCM(a, b) <= threshold. The connected components are the equivalence classes under the transitive closure of this relation.

   But how to compute this efficiently.

   Let's think of the following:

   For each number a, the numbers that can be connected to it are those that are in the same "group" where their product divided by their GCD is <= threshold.

   But again, not helpful.

   Another approach: For each number a, the maximum possible number that can be connected to it is threshold. Because if a and b are connected, their LCM is <= threshold. So if a is larger than threshold, then b must be <= threshold. But if a is larger than threshold, then LCM(a, b) >= a > threshold, so a can't be connected to any other number. So all numbers larger than threshold are isolated components.

   So the first step is to separate the numbers into those <= threshold and those > threshold. The latter are each their own component.

   For the numbers <= threshold, we need to find their connected components.

   Now, the problem reduces to processing the numbers <= threshold.

   Let's focus on these numbers.

   For these numbers, the LCM of any two can be up to threshold. So how to find connected components.

   Let's think of the following:

   For each number a in the sorted list (sorted in increasing order), we can find all numbers b in the list where LCM(a, b) <= threshold. For each such b, merge a and b in the union-find structure.

   But how to find these b's efficiently.

   Since the list is sorted, for a given a, the possible b's are those where LCM(a, b) <= threshold. But how to find them.

   Let's think of the LCM condition again: LCM(a, b) = (a*b) / gcd(a, b) <= threshold.

   So a*b <= threshold * gcd(a, b).

   Since a and b are both <= threshold, their product can be up to (threshold)^2. But the right-hand side is threshold * gcd(a, b), which can be up to threshold * a (if b is a multiple of a). So for a and b to satisfy the condition, their product must be <= threshold * gcd(a, b).

   But this is not helpful.

   Another idea: For a given a, the maximum possible b that can form an edge with a is when LCM(a, b) is as small as possible. For example, if a and b are coprime, then LCM(a, b) = a*b. So for a*b <= threshold, they can be connected. But if a and b are not coprime, then LCM(a, b) is smaller.

   So for a given a, the possible b's are those where a*b / gcd(a, b) <= threshold.

   But how to find these b's.

   Let's think of the following:

   For each a, iterate through all possible divisors d of a. For each d, compute the maximum possible multiple of d that can be in the array and satisfy the LCM condition.

   But this is similar to the previous approach and may not be feasible.

   Another idea: For each a, the numbers that can be connected to it are those that are in the range [1, threshold] and for which there exists a path of numbers where each step's LCM is <= threshold.

   But this is not helpful.

   Let's think of the problem in terms of the union-find data structure. We need to process the numbers in a way that allows us to merge their sets efficiently.

   Here's a possible approach:

   1. Sort the array in increasing order.

   2. Create a hash set for O(1) lookups.

   3. For each a in the sorted array:

      a. If a > threshold: add to the count as a separate component. Continue.

      b. Else:

         i. For each divisor d of a:

             - Compute x = a/d.

             - The maximum possible y is threshold // (d * x).

             - For each possible y in 1 to y_max:

                 - Check if d*y is present in the array.

                 - If yes, and d*y is not a, merge a and d*y.

         ii. Also, check for multiples of a up to threshold. For each multiple m = a*k where m <= threshold:

                 - If m is present in the array, merge a and m.

   But this approach is still O(n * d(a) * y_max), which is not feasible for large a.

   For example, if a=1 and threshold=2e5, then d=1, x=1. y_max=2e5. So for each y from 1 to 2e5, check if y is present. This is O(2e5) per a, which is impossible for n=1e5.

   So this approach is not feasible.

   Hmm. So what's the alternative?

   Let's think of the problem differently. For each number a, the numbers that can be connected to it are those that are in the same "group" where their product divided by their GCD is <= threshold. But how to model this.

   Another idea: For each number a, the numbers that can be connected to it are those that are in the set S_a = {x | x <= threshold, and x divides a * k for some k <= threshold / a}.

   Not sure.

   Alternatively, for each a, the numbers that can be connected to it are those x where x <= threshold and a <= threshold, and there exists a path between them.

   But again, not helpful.

   Let's think of the problem in terms of the connected components. Each component is a set of numbers where any two numbers in the set can be connected via a path where each step's LCM is <= threshold.

   So the problem is to find the number of such sets.

   But how to model this.

   Let's think of the following:

   For each number a, the numbers that can be connected to it are those that are in the same component as a. So the component of a includes all numbers that can be reached from a via edges where LCM is <= threshold.

   So the problem is to find the connected components of this graph.

   But how to compute this efficiently.

   The key insight is that the connected components can be determined by the set of numbers that share a common divisor that allows their LCM to be within the threshold.

   But I'm not sure.

   Another idea: For each number a, the component can include all numbers that are divisors of a, multiples of a, or numbers that are coprime with a but their product is <= threshold.

   But again, not helpful.

   Let's think of the example where a=2 and threshold=6. The component includes 2,3,4,6. Because:

   - 2 and 4 are connected (LCM 4).

   - 2 and 3 are connected (LCM 6).

   - 3 and 6 are connected (LCM 6).

   So the component is {2,3,4,6}.

   So the component is formed by numbers that are connected via multiple steps.

   So the problem is to find all such connected components.

   But how to model this.

   Let's think of the following approach:

   - Use a union-find data structure.

   - For each number a in the array (sorted in increasing order):

      - For each number b in the array where b >= a:

         - If LCM(a, b) <= threshold, merge a and b.

   But this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

   So this approach is not possible.

   Another idea: For each a, find all numbers b where b is in the array, and LCM(a, b) <= threshold. Then, merge a and b. But again, how to find these b's efficiently.

   Let's think of the following:

   For each a, the numbers b that can form an edge with a are those where LCM(a, b) <= threshold. So for a given a, the possible b's are those where b <= threshold and a <= threshold, and (a*b) / gcd(a, b) <= threshold.

   But how to find these b's.

   Let's rearrange the inequality:

   a*b <= threshold * gcd(a, b)

   Since gcd(a, b) divides both a and b, let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then a = d * x, b = d * y, where x and y are coprime. The inequality becomes d^2 * x * y <= threshold * d → d * x * y <= threshold.

   So for a given a (d*x), we need to find all b (d*y) in the array such that:

   - d*y is present in the array.

   - y is coprime with x.

   - d*x*y <= threshold.

   So for each a, we can iterate over all possible divisors d of a (since d must divide a), and for each d, compute x = a/d. Then, find all y's such that d*y is in the array, y is coprime with x, and d*x*y <= threshold.

   But how to find these y's.

   For each d, the maximum possible y is threshold // (d*x). So y_max = threshold // (d*x).

   Then, for each y in 1 to y_max, check if d*y is present in the array, and gcd(x, y) == 1.

   But this is again O(d(a) * y_max) per a, which is not feasible for large a.

   For example, if a=1, d=1, x=1. y_max = threshold. So for threshold=2e5, this would require checking 2e5 y's per a. For n=1e5, this is 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.

   So this approach is not feasible.

   Hmm. So what's the alternative?

   Let's think of the problem in terms of the following observation: two numbers a and b are in the same component if there exists a sequence of numbers where each consecutive pair has LCM <= threshold.

   So the connected components are determined by the transitive closure of the LCM condition.

   But how to model this.

   Another idea: For each number a, the component can include all numbers that are in the set {x | x <= threshold and x is a multiple of a or a divisor of a, or x is such that LCM(a, x) <= threshold}.

   But this is not helpful.

   Let's think of the problem in terms of the following:

   The connected components are determined by the set of numbers that can be connected via a chain of numbers where each step's LCM is <= threshold.

   So, for example, if a and b are connected, and b and c are connected, then a and c are in the same component.

   So the problem is to find the connected components of this graph.

   But how to compute this efficiently.

   The key is to find a way to model the connected components without explicitly checking all pairs.

   Let's think of the following approach:

   - Sort the array in increasing order.

   - For each a in the array:

      - If a > threshold: add to the count as a separate component. Continue.

      - Else:

         - For each number b in the array where b >= a:

             - If LCM(a, b) <= threshold, merge a and b.

   But this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

   So this approach is not possible.

   Another idea: For each a, find all numbers b where b is in the array, and b is a multiple of a, and b <= threshold. Merge a and b.

   Also, find all numbers b where b is a divisor of a, and a <= threshold. Merge a and b.

   Then, for the remaining pairs (a, b) where neither is a multiple of the other, but their LCM is <= threshold, find a way to merge them.

   But how to find those pairs.

   This seems like a dead end.

   Let's think of the problem from another angle. The connected components are formed by numbers that can be connected via a chain of numbers where each step's LCM is <= threshold. So the component is the closure of the LCM relation.

   So, for example, if a and b are connected, and b and c are connected, then a and c are in the same component.

   So the problem is to find the number of such closures.

   But how to compute this.

   Let's think of the following:

   For each number a, the component can include all numbers that are in the same "group" where their product divided by their GCD is <= threshold. But this is not directly helpful.

   Another idea: For each number a, the component can include all numbers that are in the set S_a = {x | x <= threshold and there exists a sequence of numbers a_0=a, a_1, ..., a_k=x such that LCM(a_i, a_{i+1}) <= threshold for all i}.

   But how to compute this.

   This seems like a graph problem where we need to find the connected components of a graph with edges defined by LCM(a, b) <= threshold. But with n=1e5, we can't build the graph explicitly.

   So we need a way to model the connected components without building the graph.

   Let's think of the following:

   The connected components are determined by the set of numbers that can be connected via a chain of numbers where each step's LCM is <= threshold.

   So, for example, if a and b are connected, and b and c are connected, then a and c are in the same component.

   So the problem is to find the number of such components.

   But how to model this.

   Let's think of the following approach:

   - Use a union-find data structure.

   - For each number a in the array:

      - For each number b in the array where b >= a:

         - If LCM(a, b) <= threshold, merge a and b.

   But this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

   So this approach is not possible.

   Another idea: For each number a, find all numbers b where b is in the array, and LCM(a, b) <= threshold. Then, merge a and b. But how to find these b's efficiently.

   Let's think of the following:

   For each a, the numbers b that can form an edge with a are those where LCM(a, b) <= threshold. So for a given a, the possible b's are those where b <= threshold and a <= threshold, and (a*b) / gcd(a, b) <= threshold.

   But how to find these b's.

   Let's rearrange the inequality:

   a*b <= threshold * gcd(a, b)

   Since gcd(a, b) divides both a and b, let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then a = d * x, b = d * y, where x and y are coprime. The inequality becomes d^2 * x * y <= threshold * d → d * x * y <= threshold.

   So for a given a (d*x), we need to find all b (d*y) in the array such that:

   - d*y is present in the array.

   - y is coprime with x.

   - d*x*y <= threshold.

   So for each a, we can iterate over all possible divisors d of a, compute x = a/d, and then find all y's such that d*y is in the array, y is coprime with x, and d*x*y <= threshold.

   But how to find these y's.

   For each d, the maximum possible y is threshold // (d*x). So y_max = threshold // (d*x).

   Then, for each y in 1 to y_max, check if d*y is present in the array, and gcd(x, y) == 1.

   But this is again O(d(a) * y_max) per a, which is not feasible for large a.

   For example, if a=1, d=1, x=1. y_max = threshold. So for threshold=2e5, this would require checking 2e5 y's per a. For n=1e5, this is 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.

   So this approach is not feasible.

   Hmm. So what's the solution here?

   Let's think of the problem's constraints. The threshold is up to 2e5, and the numbers can be up to 1e9. But the numbers in the array are unique.

   Maybe we can precompute for each possible d, the numbers in the array that are multiples of d. Then, for each a, we can find the divisors d of a, and for each d, find the multiples of d in the array that meet the conditions.

   For example, for each d, we can have a list of numbers in the array that are multiples of d. Then, for a given a and d (divisor of a), we can iterate through the multiples of d in the array and check if they meet the conditions.

   But how to do this efficiently.

   Let's outline the steps:

   1. Preprocess the array by creating a hash map where the key is a number, and the value is a list of numbers in the array that are multiples of the key. But this is not feasible for large numbers.

   Alternatively, create a dictionary where the key is d, and the value is a sorted list of numbers in the array that are multiples of d.

   This can be done by iterating through each number in the array and adding it to the lists of all its divisors. But this is O(n * d(a)), which is not feasible for large a.

   For example, if a number has 1e3 divisors, and n=1e5, this is 1e8 operations.

   So this approach is not feasible.

   Another idea: For each number in the array, add it to the list of its divisors. But again, this is O(n * d(a)), which is not feasible.

   So this approach is not possible.

   Hmm. So what's the solution here?

   Let's think of the problem's example 2:

   nums = [2,4,8,3,9,12], threshold = 10.

   The connected components are (2,3,4,8,9) and (12).

   Let's see why:

   - 2 and 4 are connected (LCM 4).

   - 4 and 8 are connected (LCM 8).

   - 2 and 3 are connected (LCM 6).

   - 3 and 9 are connected (LCM 9).

   So all these are in the same component.

   So the component is formed by numbers that are connected via multiple steps.

   So the key is to find all numbers that can be connected via such steps.

   But how to model this.

   Let's think of the following:

   For each number a, the component can include all numbers that are in the same "group" where their product divided by their GCD is <= threshold. But this is not directly helpful.

   Another idea: For each number a, the component can include all numbers that are in the set S_a = {x | x <= threshold and there exists a chain of numbers a_0=a, a_1, ..., a_k=x such that LCM(a_i, a_{i+1}) <= threshold for all i}.

   But how to compute this.

   This seems like a graph problem where we need to find the connected components of a graph with edges defined by LCM(a, b) <= threshold. But with n=1e5, we can't build the graph explicitly.

   So we need a way to model the connected components without building the graph.

   Let's think of the following approach:

   - Sort the array in increasing order.

   - For each a in the array:

      - If a > threshold: add to the count as a separate component. Continue.

      - Else:

         - For each number b in the array where b >= a:

             - If LCM(a, b) <= threshold, merge a and b.

   But this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

   So this approach is not possible.

   Another idea: For each a, find all numbers b where b is in the array, and LCM(a, b) <= threshold. Then, merge a and b. But how to find these b's efficiently.

   Let's think of the following:

   For each a, the numbers b that can form an edge with a are those where LCM(a, b) <= threshold. So for a given a, the possible b's are those where b <= threshold and a <= threshold, and (a*b) / gcd(a, b) <= threshold.

   But how to find these b's.

   Let's rearrange the inequality:

   a*b <= threshold * gcd(a, b)

   Since gcd(a, b) divides both a and b, let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then a = d * x, b = d * y, where x and y are coprime. The inequality becomes d^2 * x * y <= threshold * d → d * x * y <= threshold.

   So for a given a (d*x), we need to find all b (d*y) in the array such that:

   - d*y is present in the array.

   - y is coprime with x.

   - d*x*y <= threshold.

   So for each a, we can iterate over all possible divisors d of a, compute x = a/d, and then find all y's such that d*y is in the array, y is coprime with x, and d*x*y <= threshold.

   But how to find these y's.

   For each d, the maximum possible y is threshold // (d*x). So y_max = threshold // (d*x).

   Then, for each y in 1 to y_max, check if d*y is present in the array, and gcd(x, y) == 1.

   But this is again O(d(a) * y_max) per a, which is not feasible for large a.

   For example, if a=1, d=1, x=1. y_max = threshold. So for threshold=2e5, this would require checking 2e5 y's per a. For n=1e5, this is 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.

   So this approach is not feasible.

   Hmm. So what's the solution here?

   Let's think of the problem's constraints again. The threshold is up to 2e5, and the numbers can be up to 1e9. But the numbers in the array are unique.

   Maybe we can precompute for each possible d, the numbers in the array that are multiples of d. Then, for each a, we can find the divisors d of a, and for each d, find the multiples of d in the array that meet the conditions.

   For example, for each d, we can have a list of numbers in the array that are multiples of d. Then, for a given a and d (divisor of a), we can iterate through the multiples of d in the array and check if they meet the conditions.

   But how to do this efficiently.

   Let's outline the steps:

   1. Preprocess the array by creating a hash map where the key is a number, and the value is a list of numbers in the array that are multiples of the key. But this is not feasible for large numbers.

   Alternatively, create a dictionary where the key is d, and the value is a sorted list of numbers in the array that are multiples of d.

   This can be done by iterating through each number in the array and adding it to the lists of all its divisors. But this is O(n * d(a)), which is not feasible for large a.

   For example, if a number has 1e3 divisors, and n=1e5, this is 1e8 operations.

   So this approach is not feasible.

   Another idea: For each number in the array, add it to the list of its divisors. But again, this is O(n * d(a)), which is not feasible.

   So this approach is not possible.

   Hmm. So what's the solution here?

   Let's think of the problem's example 2 again. The component includes 2,3,4,8,9,12. Wait, no, the example says the components are (2,3,4,8,9) and (12). So 12 is a separate component.

   So 12 is larger than threshold=10. So it's a separate component.

   So the numbers <= threshold are 2,3,4,8,9.

   So for these numbers, how are they connected?

   2 and 4 are connected (LCM 4).

   4 and 8 are connected (LCM 8).

   2 and 3 are connected (LCM 6).

   3 and 9 are connected (LCM 9).

   So all these are in the same component.

   So the key is that even though 2 and 3 are not directly connected via a common divisor, their LCM is 6 <= threshold, so they are connected.

   So the problem requires that even pairs of numbers that are not divisors or multiples can be connected if their LCM is <= threshold.

   So the previous approaches that only consider divisors and multiples are insufficient.

   So what's the solution here?

   Let's think of the following:

   For each number a in the array (sorted in increasing order), we can find all numbers b in the array where LCM(a, b) <= threshold. For each such b, merge a and b in the union-find structure.

   But how to find these b's efficiently.

   Since the array is sorted, for a given a, the possible b's are those where LCM(a, b) <= threshold. But how to find them.

   Let's think of the following:

   For each a, iterate through all possible divisors d of a. For each d, compute x = a/d. Then, the maximum possible y is threshold // (d*x). For each y in 1 to y_max, check if d*y is present in the array. If yes, and gcd(x, y) == 1, then merge a and d*y.

   Also, for each a, iterate through all multiples of a up to threshold. For each multiple m = a*k, check if m is present in the array. If yes, merge a and m.

   This approach would cover all possible edges where a and b are connected via LCM(a, b) <= threshold.

   But how to implement this efficiently.

   Let's outline the steps:

   1. Sort the array in increasing order.

   2. Create a hash set for O(1) lookups.

   3. Create a union-find data structure.

   4. For each a in the sorted array:

      a. If a > threshold: add to the count as a separate component. Continue.

      b. Else:

         i. Find all divisors d of a.

         ii. For each d:

             - x = a/d.

             - y_max = threshold // (d * x).

             - if y_max < 1: continue.

             - for y in 1 to y_max:

                 - if d*y is in the array:

                     - if gcd(x, y) == 1:

                         - merge a and d*y.

         iii. Find all multiples m of a where m <= threshold.

             - for m in a, 2a, 3a, ... up to threshold:

                 - if m is in the array:

                     - merge a and m.

   But this approach is still O(n * (d(a) * y_max + threshold/a)), which is not feasible for large a.

   For example, if a=1, threshold=2e5:

   - d=1, x=1. y_max=2e5. So for each y from 1 to 2e5, check if y is present. This is O(2e5) per a.

   For n=1e5, this is 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.

   So this approach is not feasible.

   Hmm. So what's the solution here?

   Let's think of the problem's constraints again. The threshold is up to 2e5, and the numbers can be up to 1e9. But the numbers in the array are unique.

   Maybe we can precompute for each possible d, the numbers in the array that are multiples of d. Then, for each a, we can find the divisors d of a, and for each d, find the multiples of d in the array that meet the conditions.

   But how to do this efficiently.

   Let's think of the following:

   - Precompute a dictionary where the key is d, and the value is a sorted list of numbers in the array that are multiples of d.

   - For each a in the array:

      - If a > threshold: add to the count as a separate component. Continue.

      - Else:

         - Find all divisors d of a.

         - For each d:

             - x = a/d.

             - y_max = threshold // (d * x).

             - if y_max < 1: continue.

             - Get the list of multiples of d from the dictionary.

             - For each multiple m in the list where m <= d*y_max:

                 - y = m/d.

                 - if gcd(x, y) == 1:

                     - merge a and m.

         - Find all multiples m of a where m <= threshold.

             - Check if m is in the array (using the hash set).

             - merge a and m.

   This approach would reduce the number of checks for multiples, but the problem is that the list of multiples of d can be large.

   For example, if d=1 and threshold=2e5, the list of multiples of 1 is the entire array. So for a=1, this would require iterating through all numbers in the array, which is O(n) per a.

   So this approach is not feasible.

   Hmm. So what's the solution here?

   Let's think of the problem's constraints again. The threshold is up to 2e5, and the numbers can be up to 1e9. But the numbers in the array are unique.

   Maybe the key is to process the numbers in a certain order and use the union-find structure to merge them efficiently.

   Let's think of the following:

   - Sort the array in increasing order.

   - For each a in the array:

      - If a > threshold: add to the count as a separate component. Continue.

      - Else:

         - For each number b in the array where b >= a:

             - If LCM(a, b) <= threshold, merge a and b.

   But this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

   So this approach is not possible.

   Another idea: For each a, find all numbers b where b is in the array, and LCM(a, b) <= threshold. Then, merge a and b. But how to find these b's efficiently.

   Let's think of the following:

   For each a, the numbers b that can form an edge with a are those where LCM(a, b) <= threshold. So for a given a, the possible b's are those where b <= threshold and a <= threshold, and (a*b) / gcd(a, b) <= threshold.

   But how to find these b's.

   Let's rearrange the inequality:

   a*b <= threshold * gcd(a, b)

   Since gcd(a, b) divides both a and b, let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then a = d * x, b = d * y, where x and y are coprime. The inequality becomes d^2 * x * y <= threshold * d → d * x * y <= threshold.

   So for a given a (d*x), we need to find all b (d*y) in the array such that:

   - d*y is present in the array.

   - y is coprime with x.

   - d*x*y <= threshold.

   So for each a, we can iterate over all possible divisors d of a, compute x = a/d, and then find all y's such that d*y is in the array, y is coprime with x, and d*x*y <= threshold.

   But how to find these y's.

   For each d, the maximum possible y is threshold // (d*x). So y_max = threshold // (d*x).

   Then, for each y in 1 to y_max, check if d*y is present in the array, and gcd(x, y) == 1.

   But this is again O(d(a) * y_max) per a, which is not feasible for large a.

   For example, if a=1, d=1, x=1. y_max = threshold. So for threshold=2e5, this would require checking 2e5 y's per a. For n=1e5, this is 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.

   So this approach is not feasible.

   Hmm. So what's the solution here?

   Let's think of the problem's example 2 again. The component includes 2,3,4,8,9. So 2 and 3 are connected via LCM 6, which is <=10. 3 and 9 are connected via LCM 9. 2 and 4 are connected via LCM 4. 4 and 8 are connected via LCM 8. So all are in the same component.

   So the key is that even though 2 and 3 are not divisors or multiples, their LCM is <= threshold.

   So the problem requires that even pairs of numbers that are not divisors or multiples can be connected if their LCM is <= threshold.

   So the previous approaches that only consider divisors and multiples are insufficient.

   So what's the solution here?

   Let's think of the following:

   For each number a, the numbers that can be connected to it are those where LCM(a, b) <= threshold. So for a given a, the possible b's are those where b <= threshold and a <= threshold, and (a*b) / gcd(a, b) <= threshold.

   But how to find these b's.

   Let's think of the following:

   For each a, iterate through all possible divisors d of a. For each d, compute x = a/d. Then, the maximum possible y is threshold // (d*x). For each y in 1 to y_max, check if d*y is present in the array, and gcd(x, y) == 1. If yes, merge a and d*y.

   Also, for each a, iterate through all multiples of a up to threshold. For each multiple m = a*k, check if m is present in the array. If yes, merge a and m.

   This approach would cover all possible edges where a and b are connected via LCM(a, b) <= threshold.

   But how to implement this efficiently.

   Let's outline the steps:

   1. Sort the array in increasing order.

   2. Create a hash set for O(1) lookups.

   3. Create a union-find data structure.

   4. For each a in the sorted array:

      a. If a > threshold: add to the count as a separate component. Continue.

      b. Else:

         i. Find all divisors d of a.

         ii. For each d:

             - x = a/d.

             - y_max = threshold // (d * x).

             - if y_max < 1: continue.

             - for y in 1 to y_max:

                 - m = d * y.

                 - if m is in the array:

                     - if gcd(x, y) == 1:

                         - merge a and m.

         iii. Find all multiples m of a where m <= threshold.

             - for m in a, 2a, 3a, ... up to threshold:

                 - if m is in the array:

                     - merge a and m.

   But this approach is still O(n * (d(a) * y_max + threshold/a)), which is not feasible for large a.

   For example, if a=1, d=1, x=1. y_max = threshold. So for threshold=2e5, this would require checking 2e5 y's per a. For n=1e5, this is 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.

   So this approach is not feasible.

   Hmm. So what's the solution here?

   Let's think of the problem's constraints again. The threshold is up to 2e5, and the numbers can be up to 1e9. But the numbers in the array are unique.

   Maybe the key is to process the numbers in a certain order and use the union-find structure to merge them efficiently.

   Let's think of the following:

   - Sort the array in increasing order.

   - For each a in the array:

      - If a > threshold: add to the count as a separate component. Continue.

      - Else:

         - For each number b in the array where b >= a:

             - If LCM(a, b) <= threshold, merge a and b.

   But this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

   So this approach is not possible.

   Another idea: For each a, find all numbers b where b is in the array, and LCM(a, b) <= threshold. Then, merge a and b. But how to find these b's efficiently.

   Let's think of the following:

   For each a, the numbers b that can form an edge with a are those where LCM(a, b) <= threshold. So for a given a, the possible b's are those where b <= threshold and a <= threshold, and (a*b) / gcd(a, b) <= threshold.

   But how to find these b's.

   Let's rearrange the inequality:

   a*b <= threshold * gcd(a, b)

   Since gcd(a, b) divides both a and b, let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then a = d * x, b = d * y, where x and y are coprime. The inequality becomes d^2 * x * y <= threshold * d → d * x * y <= threshold.

   So for a given a (d*x), we need to find all b (d*y) in the array such that:

   - d*y is present in the array.

   - y is coprime with x.

   - d*x*y <= threshold.

   So for each a, we can iterate over all possible divisors d of a, compute x = a/d, and then find all y's such that d*y is in the array, y is coprime with x, and d*x*y <= threshold.

   But how to find these y's.

   For each d, the maximum possible y is threshold // (d*x). So y_max = threshold // (d*x).

   Then, for each y in 1 to y_max, check if d*y is present in the array, and gcd(x, y) == 1.

   But how to do this efficiently.

   Let's outline the steps:

   1. Preprocess the array by creating a dictionary where the key is d, and the value is a sorted list of numbers in the array that are multiples of d.

   2. For each a in the array:

             - Get the list of multiples of d from the dictionary.

             - Use binary search to find all multiples m in the list where m <= d*y_max.

             - For each such m:

                 - y = m/d.

                 - if gcd(x, y) == 1:

                     - merge a and m.

             - Check if m is in the array (using the hash set).

             - merge a and m.

   This approach would reduce the number of checks for multiples, but the problem is that the list of multiples of d can be large.

   For example, if d=1 and threshold=2e5, the list of multiples of 1 is the entire array. So for a=1, this would require iterating through all numbers in the array, which is O(n) per a.

   Also, for each a, iterate through all multiples of a up to threshold. For each multiple m = a*k, check if m is present in the array. If yes, merge a and m.

   This approach would cover all possible edges where a and b are connected via LCM(a, b) <= threshold.

   But how to implement this efficiently.

   Let's outline the steps:

   1. Sort the array in increasing order.

   2. Create a hash set for O(1) lookups.

   3. Create a union-find data structure.

   4. For each a in the sorted array:

      a. If a > threshold: add to the count as a separate component. Continue.

      b. Else:

         i. Find all divisors d of a.

         ii. For each d:

             - x = a/d.

             - y_max = threshold // (d * x).

             - if y_max < 1: continue.

             - for y in 1 to y_max:

                 - m = d * y.

                 - if m is in the array:

                     - if gcd(x, y) == 1:

                         - merge a and m.

         iii. Find all multiples m of a where m <= threshold.

             - for m in a, 2a, 3a, ... up to threshold:

                 - if m is in the array:

                     - merge a and m.

   But this approach is still O(n * (d(a) * y_max + threshold/a)), which is not feasible for large a.

   For example, if a=1, d=1, x=1. y_max = threshold. So for threshold=2e5, this would require checking 2e5 y's per a. For n=1e5, this is 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.

   So this approach is not feasible.

   Hmm. So what's the solution here?

   Let's think of the problem's constraints again. The threshold is up to 2e5, and the numbers can be up to 1e9. But the numbers in the array are unique.

   Maybe the key is to process the numbers in a certain order and use the union-find structure to merge them efficiently.

   Let's think of the following:

   - Sort the array in increasing order.

   - For each a in the array:

      - If a > threshold: add to the count as a separate component. Continue.

      - Else:

         - For each number b in the array where b >= a:

             - If LCM(a, b) <= threshold, merge a and b.

   But this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

   So this approach is not possible.

   Another idea: For each a, find all numbers b where b is in the array, and LCM(a, b) <= threshold. Then, merge a and b. But how to find these b's efficiently.

   Let's think of the following:

   For each a, the numbers b that can form an edge with a are those where LCM(a, b) <= threshold. So for a given a, the possible b's are those where b <= threshold and a <= threshold, and (a*b) / gcd(a, b) <= threshold.

   But how to find these b's.

   Let's rearrange the inequality:

   a*b <= threshold * gcd(a, b)

   Since gcd(a, b) divides both a and b, let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then a = d * x, b = d * y, where x and y are coprime. The inequality becomes d^2 * x * y <= threshold * d → d * x * y <= threshold.

   So for a given a (d*x), we need to find all b (d*y) in the array such that:

   - d*y is present in the array.

   - y is coprime with x.

   - d*x*y <= threshold.

   So for each a, we can iterate over all possible divisors d of a, compute x = a/d, and then find all y's such that d*y is in the array, y is coprime with x, and d*x*y <= threshold.

   But how to find these y's.

   For each d, the maximum possible y is threshold // (d*x). So y_max = threshold // (d*x).

   Then, for each y in 1 to y_max, check if d*y is present in the array, and gcd(x, y) == 1.

   But this is again O(d(a) * y_max) per a, which is not feasible for large a.

   For example, if a=1, d=1, x=1. y_max = threshold. So for threshold=2e5, this would require checking 2e5 y's per a. For n=1e5, this is 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.

   So this approach is not feasible.

   Hmm. So what's the solution here?

   Let's think of the problem's example 2 again. The component includes 2,3,4,8,9. So 2 and 3 are connected via LCM 6, which is <=10. 3 and 9 are connected via LCM 9. 2 and 4 are connected via LCM 4. 4 and 8 are connected via LCM 8. So all are in the same component.

   So the key is that even though 2 and 3 are not divisors or multiples, their LCM is <= threshold.

   So the problem requires that even pairs of numbers that are not divisors or multiples can be connected if their LCM is <= threshold.

   So the previous approaches that only consider divisors and multiples are insufficient.

   So what's the solution here?

   Let's think of the following:

   For each number a, the numbers that can be connected to it are those where LCM(a, b) <= threshold. So for a given a, the possible b's are those where b <= threshold and a <= threshold, and (a*b) / gcd(a, b) <= threshold.

             - for y in 1 to y_max:

                 - m = d * y.

                 - if m is in the array:

                     - if gcd(x, y) == 1:

                         - merge a and m.

             - for m in a, 2a, 3a, ... up to threshold:

                     - merge a and m.

   But this approach is still O(n * (d(a) * y_max + threshold/a)), which is not feasible for large a.

   For example, if a=1, d=1, x=1. y_max = threshold. So for threshold=2e5, this would require checking 2e5 y's per a. For n=1e5, this is 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.

   a*b <= threshold * gcd(a, b)

   Since gcd(a, b) divides both a and b, let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then a = d * x, b = d * y, where x and y are coprime. The inequality becomes d^2 * x * y <= threshold * d → d * x * y <= threshold.

   So for a given a (d*x), we need to find all b (d*y) in the array such that:

   - d*y is present in the array.

   - y is coprime with x.

   - d*x*y <= threshold.

   So for each a, we can iterate over all possible divisors d of a, compute x = a/d, and then find all y's such that d*y is in the array, y is coprime with x, and d*x*y <= threshold.

   Maybe the key is to precompute for each possible d, the numbers in the array that are multiples of d. Then, for each a, we can find the divisors d of a, and for each d, find the multiples of d in the array that meet the conditions.

   But how to do this efficiently.

   Let's outline the steps:

   1. Preprocess the array by creating a dictionary where the key is d, and the value is a sorted list of numbers in the array that are multiples of d.

   2. For each a in the array:

      a. If a > threshold: add to the count as a separate component. Continue.

             - Get the list of multiples of d from the dictionary.

             - Use binary search to find all multiples m in the list where m <= d*y_max.

             - For each such m:

                 - y = m/d.

                 - if gcd(x, y) == 1:

                     - merge a and m.

         iii. Find all multiples m of a where m <= threshold.

             - Check if m is in the array (using the hash set).

             - merge a and m.

   This approach would reduce the number of checks for multiples, but the problem is that the list of multiples of d can be large.

   For example, if d=1 and threshold=2e5, the list of multiples of 1 is the entire array. So for a=1, this would require iterating through all numbers in the array, which is O(n) per a.

   So this approach is not feasible.

   Let's think of the problem's constraints again. The threshold is up to 2e5, and the numbers can be up to 1e9. But the numbers in the array are unique.

   Maybe the key is to precompute for each possible d, the numbers in the array that are multiples of d. Then, for each a, we can find the divisors d of a, and for each d, find the multiples of d in the array that meet the conditions.

   But how to do this efficiently.

   Let's outline the steps:

   1. Preprocess the array by creating a dictionary where the key is d, and the value is a sorted list of numbers in the array that are multiples of d.

   2. For each a in the array:

      a. If a > threshold: add to the count as a separate component. Continue.

      b. Else:

         i. Find all divisors d of a.

         ii. For each d:

             - x = a/d.

             - y_max = threshold // (d * x).

             - if y_max < 1: continue.

             - Get the list of multiples of d from the dictionary.

             - Use binary search to find all multiples m in the list where m <= d*y_max.

             - For each such m:

                 - y = m/d.

                 - if gcd(x, y) == 1:

                     - merge a and m.

         iii. Find all multiples m of a where m <= threshold.

             - Check if m is in the array (using the hash set).

             - merge a and m.

   This approach would reduce the number of checks for multiples, but the problem is that the list of multiples of d can be large.

   For example, if d=1 and threshold=2e5, the list of multiples of 1 is the entire array. So for a=1, this would require iterating through all numbers in the array, which is O(n) per a.

   So this approach is not feasible.

   Hmm. So what's the solution here?

   Let's think of the problem's example 2 again. The component includes 2,3,4,8,9. So 2 and 3 are connected via LCM 6, which is <=10. 3 and 9 are connected via LCM 9. 2 and 4 are connected via LCM 4. 4 and 8 are connected via LCM 8. So all are in the same component.

   So the key is that even though 2 and 3 are not divisors or multiples, their LCM is <= threshold.

   So the problem requires that even pairs of numbers that are not divisors or multiples can be connected if their LCM is <= threshold.

   So the previous approaches that only consider divisors and multiples are insufficient.

   So what's the solution here?

   Let's think of the following:

   For each number a, the numbers that can be connected to it are those where LCM(a, b) <= threshold. So for a given a, the possible b's are those where b <= threshold and a <= threshold, and (a*b) / gcd(a, b) <= threshold.

   But how to find these b's.

   Let's think of the following:

   For each a, iterate through all possible divisors d of a. For each d, compute x = a/d. Then, the maximum possible y is threshold // (d*x). For each y in 1 to y_max, check if d*y is present in the array, and gcd(x, y) == 1. If yes, merge a and d*y.

   Also, for each a, iterate through all multiples of a up to threshold. For each multiple m = a*k, check if m is present in the array. If yes, merge a and m.

   This approach would cover all possible edges where a and b are connected via LCM(a, b) <= threshold.

   But how to implement this efficiently.

   Let's outline the steps:

   1. Sort the array in increasing order.

   2. Create a hash set for O(1) lookups.

   3. Create a union-find data structure.

   4. For each a in the sorted array:

      a. If a > threshold: add to the count as a separate component. Continue.

      b. Else:

         i. Find all divisors d of a.

         ii. For each d:

             - x = a/d.

             - y_max = threshold // (d * x).

             - if y_max < 1: continue.

             - for y in 1 to y_max:

                 - m = d * y.

                 - if m is in the array:

                     - if gcd(x, y) == 1:

                         - merge a and m.

         iii. Find all multiples m of a where m <= threshold.

             - for m in a, 2a, 3a, ... up to threshold:

                 - if m is in the array:

                     - merge a and m.

   But this approach is still O(n * (d(a) * y_max + threshold/a)), which is not feasible for large a.

   For example, if a=1, d=1, x=1. y_max = threshold. So for threshold=2e5, this would require checking 2e5 y's per a. For n=1e5, this is 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.

   So this approach is not feasible.

   Hmm. So what's the solution here?

   Let's think of the problem's constraints again. The threshold is up to 2e5, and the numbers can be up to 1e9. But the numbers in the array are unique.

   Maybe the key is to process the numbers in a certain order and use the union-find structure to merge them efficiently.

   Let's think of the following:

   - Sort the array in increasing order.

   - For each a in the array:

      - If a > threshold: add to the count as a separate component. Continue.

      - Else:

         - For each number b in the array where b >= a:

             - If LCM(a, b) <= threshold, merge a and b.

   But this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

   So this approach is not possible.

   Another idea: For each a, find all numbers b where b is in the array, and LCM(a, b) <= threshold. Then, merge a and b. But how to find these b's efficiently.

   Let's think of the following:

   For each a, the numbers b that can form an edge with a are those where LCM(a, b) <= threshold. So for a given a, the possible b's are those where b <= threshold and a <= threshold, and (a*b) / gcd(a, b) <= threshold.

   But how to find these b's.

   Let's rearrange the inequality:

   a*b <= threshold * gcd(a, b)

   Since gcd(a, b) divides both a and b, let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then a = d * x, b = d * y, where x and y are coprime. The inequality becomes d^2 * x * y <= threshold * d → d * x * y <= threshold.

   So for a given a (d*x), we need to find all b (d*y) in the array such that:

   - d*y is present in the array.

   - y is coprime with x.

   - d*x*y <= threshold.

   So for each a, we can iterate over all possible divisors d of a, compute x = a/d, and then find all y's such that d*y is in the array, y is coprime with x, and d*x*y <= threshold.

   But how to find these y's.

   For each d, the maximum possible y is threshold // (d*x). So y_max = threshold // (d*x).

   Then, for each y in 1 to y_max, check if d*y is present in the array, and gcd(x, y) == 1.

   But this is again O(d(a) * y_max) per a, which is not feasible for large a.

   For example, if a=1, d=1, x=1. y_max = threshold. So for threshold=2e5, this would require checking 2e5 y's per a. For n=1e5, this is 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.

             - for y in 1 to y_max:

                 - if m is in the array:

                     - merge a and m.

   But this approach is still O(n * (d(a) * y_max + threshold/a)), which is not feasible for large a.

   For example, if a=1, d=1, x=1. y_max = threshold. So for threshold=2e5, this would require checking 2e5 y's per a. For n=1e5, this is 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.

   So for a given a (d*x), we need to find all b (d*y) in the array such that:

   - d*y is present in the array.

   - y is coprime with x.

   - d*x*y <= threshold.

   So for each a, we can iterate over all possible divisors d of a, compute x = a/d, and then find all y's such that d*y is in the array, y is coprime with x, and d*x*y <= threshold.
