Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of stepping numbers between two given numbers, low and high. The stepping numbers are those where each adjacent digit differs by exactly 1. And the numbers can be very large, up to 1e100, so I can't just convert them to integers directly. Hmm.

First, I remember that for problems involving numbers represented as strings, especially very large ones, dynamic programming (DP) is often useful. But how to model the stepping numbers here?

Let me think about the structure of a stepping number. Each digit after the first must differ by 1 from the previous. So for example, 123 is a stepping number because 1 and 2 differ by 1, 2 and 3 differ by 1. But 135 is not because 3 and 5 differ by 2.

So the approach might involve generating all possible stepping numbers and checking if they fall within the [low, high] range. But generating all possible stepping numbers up to 1e100 is impossible directly. So we need a smarter way.

Wait, but the problem requires counting the numbers between low and high. So perhaps we can compute the total number of stepping numbers up to high, subtract the number of stepping numbers up to low-1, and take the result. That way, we can handle the range efficiently.

But how to compute the number of stepping numbers up to a certain number N (given as a string)? That's the key part.

So the plan is:

1. Compute f(high) - the count of stepping numbers from 0 to high.
2. Compute g(low - 1) - the count from 0 to low-1.
3. The answer is (f(high) - g(low-1)) mod 1e9+7.

But wait, the problem says the stepping numbers should not have leading zeros. So numbers like 0 are allowed? Wait, the note says a stepping number should not have a leading zero. So 0 is allowed (since it's a single digit), but numbers like 01 are not. So for numbers with more than one digit, the first digit can't be zero.

So when generating stepping numbers, for numbers with length >1, the first digit must be non-zero.

So the DP approach for counting stepping numbers up to a certain number N would need to track:

- The current position in the number.
- The previous digit (to check the difference).
- Whether the number being built is already less than the prefix of N up to this position (so that the remaining digits can be anything) or is still equal (so the next digits can't exceed the corresponding digits in N).

Additionally, leading zeros are a problem. But since the numbers can't have leading zeros, except for the number 0 itself. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the input low and high are positive integers. So the stepping numbers in the range [low, high] are all positive. So 0 is not included. So when building the numbers, we need to ensure that numbers with length >1 do not start with 0.

So the DP needs to track:

- The length of the number being built (to handle leading zeros).
- The previous digit (to enforce the stepping condition).
- The tight constraint (whether the current prefix is equal to the prefix of N, so that the next digits can't exceed the corresponding digits in N).

Hmm. So the DP state could be something like:

dp[pos][prev][tight][leading_zero]

But that's a lot of states. Let's think.

Alternatively, for numbers with leading zeros, we can treat them as not valid except when the entire number is zero. But since the problem's low and high are positive, maybe we can ignore the zero case. Wait, but when low is "1", then numbers like 0 are not counted. So in our function that counts up to N, we need to include 0 only if N is >=0, but since the problem's inputs are positive, perhaps the function for f(high) would include 0, but when we subtract, it's okay.

Wait, but the problem says that the stepping numbers in the range [low, high] are counted. So if low is "0", then 0 would be included. But according to the problem statement, the inputs low and high are positive integers. Wait, the problem says "two positive integers low and high". So the inputs are such that low and high are positive. So 0 is not part of the input range. So in our functions, when we compute up to high, 0 is included, but since low is at least 1, subtracting the count up to low-1 (which could be 0) would exclude it. So the functions need to count 0 as a valid stepping number if it's in the range.

But according to the problem's note, a stepping number should not have a leading zero. So 0 is allowed (since it's a single digit, no leading zeros). So 0 is a valid stepping number. But in the problem's examples, the first example starts at 1, so 0 is not counted. But if the low was "0", then 0 would be included.

But according to the problem's constraints, low and high are positive integers, so the inputs will not have 0. So perhaps the functions can safely include 0, but when the problem's inputs are given, the low is at least 1, so 0 is not part of the answer. But the code should handle it correctly.

So, the approach is to compute the count of stepping numbers from 0 to high, subtract the count from 0 to (low-1), and return the difference.

But how to compute the count of stepping numbers up to a given number N (as a string)?

This is similar to the problem of counting numbers with certain digit properties up to N, which is a classic digit DP problem.

So the digit DP approach would involve building the number digit by digit, keeping track of the previous digit (to check the stepping condition), whether the current number is already less than the prefix of N (so that the remaining digits can be anything), and whether the number has leading zeros.

So the DP state can be:

- pos: current digit position being processed.
- prev: the previous digit (or None if it's the first digit and leading zeros are allowed).
- tight: a boolean indicating whether the current prefix is exactly the same as N's prefix up to this position. If tight is True, the next digit can't exceed the corresponding digit in N. If False, the next digits can be anything (0-9).
- leading_zero: a boolean indicating whether the current number is still all leading zeros. This is needed to handle leading zeros properly. For example, if leading_zero is True, the next digit can be 0 (but that would continue leading zeros) or a non-zero digit (which would start the actual number).

But this might get complicated. Let's think of the DP state as:

dp[pos][prev][is_tight][leading_zero]

But the state space could be manageable.

The transitions would be as follows:

At each step, for the current position, we can choose a digit d. The choice of d depends on the is_tight constraint. If is_tight is True, then d can be at most the current digit in N. Otherwise, d can be 0-9.

But also, the digit d must differ by exactly 1 from the previous digit (prev). Except for the first digit (when leading_zero is True). Wait, no. The first digit (when leading_zero is True) can be 0, but if leading_zero is True and we choose a non-zero digit, then leading_zero becomes False, and the next digits must follow the stepping rule.

Wait, the leading_zero flag is necessary to track whether the number is still all zeros. For example, if we have a number like "000123", it's actually 123, but leading zeros are not allowed. So in the DP, when leading_zero is True, the digits chosen so far are all zeros, and the next digit can be zero ( continuing leading zeros) or a non-zero (starting the actual number).

So, for the first digit (when leading_zero is True), the next digit can be 0 (but that would keep leading_zero as True) or any non-zero (which would start the actual number, and leading_zero becomes False). However, once leading_zero is False, all subsequent digits must follow the stepping rule.

So, the transitions would be:

For each state (pos, prev, is_tight, leading_zero):

If leading_zero is True:

- If we choose d=0: leading_zero remains True, prev remains None (since the number is still all zeros), and is_tight is updated based on whether the current digit is equal to N's digit (if is_tight was True before). But since leading_zero is True, the actual number is zero, so if the current position is the first digit, then choosing 0 would be allowed even if N's first digit is higher. Wait, but N is a number like "123", and we are building a number. If leading_zero is True, then the digits so far are all zeros, but the actual number is zero. So when leading_zero is True, the digits chosen so far are not part of the actual number. So, for example, if N is "5", then numbers like "0" (which is 0) are allowed, but "5" is also allowed. But in the DP, when leading_zero is True, the digits are considered as part of the number only when a non-zero digit is chosen.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's think of the leading_zero as a state that indicates whether the number being built is all zeros so far. So, when leading_zero is True, the digits chosen so far are zeros, but the actual number is zero. Once a non-zero digit is chosen, leading_zero becomes False, and the digits form the actual number.

So, for example, if N is "123", then the number "0" is allowed (counted as 0), but "00" is not a valid number (since it's leading zeros). Wait, but according to the problem statement, leading zeros are not allowed. So numbers like "00" are invalid. So in the DP, when building the number, once leading_zero is True, any non-zero digit will start the actual number, and leading_zero becomes False. But if all digits are zero, then the number is zero (only allowed if the number is a single zero).

So, the DP needs to track:

- The current position.
- The previous digit (if leading_zero is False).
- Whether the current prefix is tight (i.e., exactly matches the prefix of N up to this position).
- Whether the number is still in leading_zero state.

So, the transitions would be:

At each step, for each possible state, we can choose a digit d.

If leading_zero is True:

- If d is 0: leading_zero remains True. The previous digit is None. The is_tight is updated based on whether the current digit (0) is equal to the corresponding digit in N. For example, if N is "5" and we are at the first position, choosing 0 would make is_tight False (since 0 <5). But if N is "0", then choosing 0 would have is_tight True (but N can't be "0" as per the problem's input constraints, since low and high are positive. But the function may be called with N being "0" in some cases, like when low is "1" and high is "0", but according to the problem statement, low <= high, so that's not possible. So perhaps the function can handle N being "0" as well.

Wait, but the problem says that low and high are positive integers, but when we compute low-1, if low is "1", then low-1 is "0". So the function that counts up to N must handle N=0.

So, in the DP, when leading_zero is True and we choose d=0, the number is still all zeros. So, for example, if N is "5", then the number "0" is allowed. But if N is "0", then the number "0" is allowed.

So, when leading_zero is True and we choose d=0, the new state is leading_zero=True, prev remains None, and is_tight is (previous is_tight) and (d == N's digit at pos). For example, if N is "5" and we are at the first position, and is_tight is True (since we are building the number equal to N's prefix), then choosing d=0 would make is_tight False (since 0 <5). If N is "0", then choosing d=0 would keep is_tight as True.

But in the case of N being "0", the only valid number is 0. So the DP would count that.

If leading_zero is True and we choose d>0:

- Then leading_zero becomes False. The previous digit is d. The is_tight is (previous is_tight) and (d == N's digit at pos). But since d is non-zero, the number starts with d, which must be <= the first digit of N (if is_tight was True). For example, if N is "5" and we choose d=3, then is_tight becomes (3 ==5) → False. So the next digits can be anything.

But the first digit (d) must be non-zero, and the next digits must differ by 1 from the previous.

So, in this case, the next digits must follow the stepping rule.

If leading_zero is False:

- The previous digit is known. The next digit must differ by exactly 1 from the previous digit. So, for example, if previous digit is 3, the next can be 2 or 4.

So, the transitions for the digits are:

For each state (pos, prev, is_tight, leading_zero):

If leading_zero is True:

   For d in 0 to 9 (but considering is_tight):

      if is_tight is True, then d can be up to the current digit in N.

      else, d can be 0-9.

      if d is 0:

          new_leading_zero = True

          new_prev = None

          new_is_tight = is_tight and (d == N[pos])

      else:

          new_leading_zero = False

          new_prev = d

          new_is_tight = is_tight and (d == N[pos])

          if new_prev is not None (i.e., d is non-zero):

              check if the digit is allowed (i.e., if is_tight, d must be <= N's digit at pos)

              then, proceed.

Else (leading_zero is False):

   For d in 0-9:

      if is_tight is True, then d must be <= N's digit at pos.

      if |d - prev| == 1:

          new_prev = d

          new_leading_zero = False (since leading_zero is already False)

          new_is_tight = is_tight and (d == N[pos])

          add to the DP state.

But wait, when leading_zero is False, the number is already started, so the digits must follow the stepping rule. So the next digit must differ by 1 from the previous.

So, in this case, the allowed digits are prev ±1, but also must be within 0-9.

So, for example, if prev is 0, the next can be 1. If prev is 9, next can be 8.

So, the transitions for leading_zero=False:

d must be prev ±1, and also must be a valid digit (0-9).

But also, if is_tight is True, then d must be <= the current digit in N.

So, the steps are:

For each possible state, iterate over possible digits d.

If leading_zero is True:

   if d is 0:

       new_leading_zero = True

       new_prev = None

       new_is_tight = is_tight and (d == N[pos])

   else:

       new_leading_zero = False

       new_prev = d

       new_is_tight = is_tight and (d == N[pos])

       if new_prev is not None (d is non-zero):

           if new_prev is not allowed (e.g., if is_tight and d > N[pos], then skip)

           else:

               proceed.

Else:

   d must be prev ±1.

   if d is not in 0-9, skip.

   if is_tight and d > N[pos], skip.

   new_prev = d

   new_leading_zero = False

   new_is_tight = is_tight and (d == N[pos])

So, the DP needs to track these states.

The base case is when pos == len(N), which means the number is complete. Then, we check if the number is a valid stepping number. But how?

Wait, the DP is built in such a way that the transitions ensure that the digits follow the stepping rule. So, the only valid numbers are those that are built through the transitions. So, when the number is complete (pos == len(N)), it's a valid stepping number, except for the case where leading_zero is True (i.e., the number is 0). But according to the problem statement, 0 is allowed as a stepping number (since it's a single digit, no leading zeros). So, in the DP, when leading_zero is True and the number is 0 (all digits are zero), then it's a valid stepping number.

Wait, but the problem says that a stepping number should not have leading zeros. So 0 is allowed, but numbers like 01 are not. So, the number 0 is allowed, but any number with more than one digit and starting with 0 is invalid.

So, in the DP, when leading_zero is True and the number is of length 1 (i.e., the entire number is 0), then it's valid. But if the number is longer than 1 and all digits are zero, then it's invalid. But in the DP, leading_zero is True only if all digits are zero. So, when the number is complete (pos == len(N)), and leading_zero is True, then the number is 0, which is valid. Otherwise, if leading_zero is False, then the number is valid.

So, the count is incremented by 1 for each state that reaches pos == len(N) and (leading_zero is True (i.e., the number is 0) or leading_zero is False (the number is non-zero and follows the stepping rules)).

But wait, when leading_zero is True, the number is 0, which is a valid stepping number. So, in the DP, when the number is built as all zeros (leading_zero is True and pos == len(N)), then it's counted as 1. Otherwise, if leading_zero is False, then the number is valid.

So, the total count is the sum over all possible states at pos == len(N) of 1, except for the case where leading_zero is True and the number is 0. Wait, no. Because leading_zero is True only if all digits are zero. So, when leading_zero is True and the number is of length 1 (like "0"), then it's valid. But if the number is longer than 1 and leading_zero is True, that's impossible because leading_zero is True only if all digits are zero, but the number can't have leading zeros. Wait, no. For example, if N is "000", then the number "000" is considered as 0, but according to the problem statement, leading zeros are not allowed. So, the number "000" is invalid. So, in the DP, when leading_zero is True and the number has length >1, it's invalid and should not be counted.

Wait, this is a problem. Because in the DP, when leading_zero is True, the digits are all zeros, but the number is considered as 0. So, for example, if N is "000", then the number "000" is 0, which is a valid stepping number. But according to the problem statement, leading zeros are not allowed. So, the number "000" is invalid. But according to the problem's note, a stepping number should not have a leading zero. So, the number 0 is allowed (as a single digit), but numbers like 00, 000, etc., are invalid because they have leading zeros.

So, in the DP, when leading_zero is True and the number's length is 1, then it's valid (counted as 1). But if the number's length is more than 1 and leading_zero is True, then it's invalid and should not be counted.

So, in the DP, when we reach pos == len(N), we need to check:

if leading_zero is True:

   if the number's length is 1 → valid (count 1)

   else → invalid (count 0)

else:

   valid (count 1)

So, the base case for the DP is:

if pos == len(N):

   if leading_zero:

       return 1 if len(N) == 1 else 0

   else:

       return 1

But wait, len(N) is the length of the number. For example, if N is "5", then len(N) is 1. So, if leading_zero is True and len(N) is 1, then the number is 0, which is valid. But if N is "05", which is not possible as per the problem's input constraints (since N is a string without leading zeros), but in the DP, when N is "05", the leading_zero is True for the first digit (0), but the second digit is 5. But in the DP, when leading_zero is True, the digits are considered as part of the number only when a non-zero digit is chosen. So, in the case of N being "05", the number "0" is allowed (counted as 0), but the number "05" is invalid (leading zero). So, in the DP, when building the number "05", leading_zero would be True for the first digit (0), then for the second digit, if we choose 5, leading_zero becomes False, and the previous digit is 5. But the number "05" is invalid because it has a leading zero. So, the DP would not count it because when leading_zero is False, the first digit is 0 (but leading_zero is False only when a non-zero digit is chosen). Wait, no. Let's see:

If N is "05", then the first digit is 0. So, when building the number, the first digit can be 0 (leading_zero remains True). Then, the second digit can be 5. But since leading_zero is True, choosing 5 would set leading_zero to False, and the previous digit is 5. But the number is "05", which is 5, but the leading zero is present. So, according to the problem's note, this is invalid. So, the DP should not count "05" as a valid stepping number.

But according to the DP transitions, when leading_zero is False, the number is considered valid. But in this case, the number "05" is invalid. So, the DP's transitions are not sufficient to capture this.

Ah, here's the problem. The DP's leading_zero flag is True only if all digits are zero. So, when building the number "05", the first digit is 0 (leading_zero is True), then the second digit is 5. So, leading_zero becomes False, and the previous digit is 5. But the number is "05", which is 5, but the leading zero is present. So, the DP would count this as a valid number (since leading_zero is False), but according to the problem's note, it's invalid.

So, the DP's approach is not capturing the leading zero condition correctly. Because the leading zero is present in the number "05", but the DP's leading_zero flag is False once a non-zero digit is added. So, the DP would count "05" as a valid number (since leading_zero is False), but it's invalid.

This indicates that the DP's state is not sufficient to track whether the number has leading zeros. Because once a non-zero digit is added, leading_zero is False, but the number may have leading zeros if the first non-zero digit is not the first digit.

Wait, no. The leading_zero flag in the DP is True only if all digits so far are zero. So, when the first non-zero digit is added, leading_zero becomes False, and the number is considered to have started. So, the number "05" would have leading_zero False (since the first digit is 0, but the second is 5). Wait, no. Let's see:

In the DP, when building the number "05", the first digit is 0. Since leading_zero is True, choosing 0 keeps leading_zero True. Then, the second digit is 5. Since leading_zero is True, choosing 5 sets leading_zero to False, and the previous digit is 5. But the number is "05", which is 5, but the leading zero is present. So, the DP would count this as a valid number (since leading_zero is False), but according to the problem's note, it's invalid.

So, the DP's approach is not capturing the leading zero condition correctly. Because the number "05" is invalid, but the DP would count it as valid.

This is a problem. So, how to model the leading zero condition correctly?

Ah, right. The leading zero condition requires that the number does not have any leading zeros. So, the first digit of the number (the leftmost non-zero digit) must be non-zero. So, for numbers with more than one digit, the first digit must be non-zero.

So, in the DP, when building the number, once leading_zero is False (i.e., the number has started), the first digit (the leftmost non-zero digit) must be non-zero. But in the case of "05", the first non-zero digit is 5, but the digit before it is 0, which is a leading zero. So, the number is invalid.

So, the DP's current approach allows numbers like "05" to be considered valid, which is incorrect.

So, the problem is that the DP's leading_zero flag is not sufficient to track whether the number has leading zeros. Because once a non-zero digit is added, leading_zero is False, but the digits before that non-zero digit (if any) are leading zeros.

So, the DP needs to track whether the number has started (i.e., whether any non-zero digit has been added). Once a non-zero digit is added, any leading zeros before it are considered invalid.

Wait, but how to model that. For example, the number "05" is invalid because it has a leading zero. The number "50" is valid (if the digits differ by 1). So, the first digit (5) is non-zero, so leading_zero is False. The second digit (0) is allowed because it's 5-1=4? No, 5 and 0 differ by 5, which is not 1. So "50" is not a stepping number.

But the point is, the first digit must be non-zero for numbers with length >1.

So, the DP needs to ensure that for numbers with length >1, the first digit is non-zero.

So, the way to model this is to track whether the number has started (i.e., whether any non-zero digit has been added). Once a non-zero digit is added, the leading_zero is False, and any subsequent digits must follow the stepping rule. But for numbers with length >1, the first digit (the leftmost digit) must be non-zero.

So, the DP needs to track whether the number has started (i.e., whether the first non-zero digit has been added). Once the number has started, the first digit is non-zero, and the rest must follow the stepping rule.

So, the state should include a flag indicating whether the number has started (i.e., whether any non-zero digit has been added). Let's call this flag 'started'.

So, the state becomes:

dp[pos][prev][is_tight][started]

Where 'started' is a boolean indicating whether the number has started (i.e., a non-zero digit has been added).

The transitions would be:

For each state (pos, prev, is_tight, started):

If started is False:

   For d in 0-9:

      if is_tight is True, d can be up to N's digit at pos.

      if d is 0:

          new_started = False

          new_prev = None

          new_is_tight = is_tight and (d == N[pos])

          proceed.

      else:

          new_started = True

          new_prev = d

          new_is_tight = is_tight and (d == N[pos])

          if new_prev is not None and (d >9 or d <0):

              skip.

          else:

              proceed.

Else:

   For d in 0-9:

      if |d - prev| == 1:

          if is_tight and d > N[pos]:

              skip.

          new_prev = d

          new_is_tight = is_tight and (d == N[pos])

          new_started = True (since started is already True)

          proceed.

So, the 'started' flag is True once a non-zero digit is added. For numbers with length >1, the first digit must be non-zero. So, when started is False, the digits can be zero, but once a non-zero digit is added, started becomes True, and the rest of the digits must follow the stepping rule.

But how to handle the case where the number has leading zeros but is followed by non-zero digits. For example, "00123" is invalid because of leading zeros. But according to the 'started' flag, once a non-zero digit is added (like the third digit 1), the started flag is True, but the previous digits (00) are leading zeros, which is invalid.

So, the 'started' flag approach is not sufficient. Because the first non-zero digit may not be the first digit. So, the number "00123" is invalid, but the DP would count it as valid once the started flag is True. But this is incorrect.

So, the problem is that the 'started' flag only indicates whether any non-zero digit has been added, but not the position of the first non-zero digit. So, the DP needs to track whether the number has started (i.e., the first non-zero digit has been added) and whether the number has leading zeros.

Alternatively, the DP can track the position of the first non-zero digit. But that would complicate the state.

Alternatively, the DP can track whether the number has leading zeros. For example, a flag 'has_leading_zeros' which is True if the number has leading zeros (i.e., the first non-zero digit hasn't been added yet). Once a non-zero digit is added, 'has_leading_zeros' becomes False.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, the DP can track the length of the number so far. For example, if the number has length 0 (no digits), then the first digit can be zero (but that's part of leading zeros). Once a non-zero digit is added, the length increases, and leading zeros are no longer allowed.

Wait, but the length is determined by the position. For example, if the number is being built digit by digit, the position indicates the current length. So, for a number with len(N) digits, the position ranges from 0 to len(N)-1.

So, for example, if the number is "05", the first digit is 0 (position 0), then 5 (position 1). The length is 2. So, the first digit is 0, which is a leading zero. The second digit is 5, which is non-zero. So, the number is invalid.

So, the DP needs to track whether the number has leading zeros. So, the state can include a flag 'leading_zeros' which is True if the number has leading zeros (i.e., the first non-zero digit hasn't been added yet). Once a non-zero digit is added, 'leading_zeros' becomes False.

So, the state is:

dp[pos][prev][is_tight][leading_zeros]

The transitions would be:

For each state (pos, prev, is_tight, leading_zeros):

If leading_zeros is True:

   For d in 0-9:

      if is_tight is True, d can be up to N's digit at pos.

      if d is 0:

          new_leading_zeros = True

          new_prev = None

          new_is_tight = is_tight and (d == N[pos])

          proceed.

      else:

          new_leading_zeros = False

          new_prev = d

          new_is_tight = is_tight and (d == N[pos])

          proceed.

Else:

   For d in 0-9:

      if |d - prev| == 1:

          if is_tight and d > N[pos]:

              skip.

          new_prev = d

          new_is_tight = is_tight and (d == N[pos])

          new_leading_zeros = False (since leading_zeros is already False)

          proceed.

So, when leading_zeros is True, the digits can be zero, but once a non-zero digit is added, leading_zeros becomes False, and the rest of the digits must follow the stepping rule.

But for numbers with leading_zeros False, the first digit (the leftmost digit) must be non-zero. So, for example, if the number is "05", the first digit is 0 (leading_zeros is True), then the second digit is 5 (leading_zeros becomes False). But the number "05" is invalid because it has a leading zero. So, the DP would count it as valid if the digits follow the stepping rule, but it's actually invalid.

So, the problem is that the leading_zeros flag only indicates whether the number has leading zeros up to the current position. But once a non-zero digit is added, the leading_zeros flag is False, but the number may have leading zeros in previous positions.

So, the DP's approach is not sufficient to capture the leading zero condition for numbers with leading zeros followed by non-zero digits.

This is a critical issue. How to model this correctly.

The correct approach is to ensure that the first digit of the number (the leftmost digit) is non-zero for numbers with length >1. So, for numbers with length >1, the first digit must be non-zero. So, the DP needs to track whether the number has started (i.e., whether the first digit is non-zero) and the length of the number.

Alternatively, the DP can track the position and whether the number has started (i.e., whether the first non-zero digit has been added). Once the number has started, the first digit is non-zero, and the rest must follow the stepping rule.

So, the state can be:

dp[pos][prev][is_tight][started]

Where 'started' is a boolean indicating whether the number has started (i.e., the first non-zero digit has been added).

The transitions would be:

For each state (pos, prev, is_tight, started):

If started is False:

   For d in 0-9:

      if is_tight is True, d can be up to N's digit at pos.

      if d is 0:

          new_started = False

          new_prev = None

          new_is_tight = is_tight and (d == N[pos])

          proceed.

      else:

          new_started = True

          new_prev = d

          new_is_tight = is_tight and (d == N[pos])

          proceed.

Else:

   For d in 0-9:

      if |d - prev| == 1:

          if is_tight and d > N[pos]:

              skip.

          new_prev = d

          new_is_tight = is_tight and (d == N[pos])

          new_started = True (since started is already True)

          proceed.

But this approach still allows numbers like "05" to be considered valid. Because the first digit is 0 (started is False), then the second digit is 5 (started becomes True). But the number "05" is invalid because it has a leading zero.

So, the problem is that the 'started' flag is True only after the first non-zero digit is added. But for numbers with length >1, the first digit must be non-zero. So, the 'started' flag should be True only if the first digit is non-zero. But in the case of "05", the first digit is 0 (started is False), then the second digit is 5 (started becomes True). But the number has length 2, so the first digit must be non-zero. So, the 'started' flag is not sufficient to capture this.

So, the correct approach is to track whether the number has started (i.e., the first digit is non-zero) and the current position. For numbers with length >1, the first digit must be non-zero. So, the 'started' flag should be True only if the first digit is non-zero, and for numbers with length >1, the 'started' flag must be True by the first position.

Wait, perhaps the 'started' flag should be True if the number has at least one non-zero digit, and the first non-zero digit is at the current position. No, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the 'started' flag can be True if the number has started (i.e., the first non-zero digit has been added), and the position is the first digit. For example, for a number of length 2, the first digit must be non-zero. So, the 'started' flag is True only if the first digit is non-zero.

But how to model this in the DP.

Alternatively, the 'started' flag can be True if the number has started (i.e., the first non-zero digit has been added), and the current position is the first digit. For numbers with length >1, the first digit must be non-zero, so the 'started' flag must be True by the first position.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, the DP can track the length of the number being built. For example, for a number with len(N) digits, the position ranges from 0 to len(N)-1. For numbers with length 1, the first digit can be 0 (but only if the number is 0). For numbers with length >1, the first digit must be non-zero.

So, the DP can track the current position and whether the number has started (i.e., whether the first digit is non-zero). For example:

- For position 0 (the first digit), if the number has length 1, then 0 is allowed. If the number has length >1, then the first digit must be non-zero.

But how to know the length of the number being built. Because the length is determined by the position. For example, if the number is being built up to position len(N)-1, then the length is len(N).

So, for a number with length 1, the first digit can be 0. For a number with length >1, the first digit must be non-zero.

So, the DP can track the current position and whether the number has started (i.e., whether the first digit is non-zero). For example:

At position 0 (the first digit):

- If the number's length is 1, then 0 is allowed (but only if the number is 0).

- If the number's length is >1, then the first digit must be non-zero.

But how to know the number's length during the DP transitions. Because the number's length is fixed (it's the same as the length of N). So, for example, if N is "123", then the number being built must have exactly 3 digits.

So, during the DP transitions, the position is known (0, 1, 2 for a 3-digit number). So, for position 0, if the number's length is 1, then the first digit can be 0. But if the number's length is >1, then the first digit must be non-zero.

Wait, but the number's length is fixed as the length of N. So, for example, if N is "123", then the number being built must have exactly 3 digits. So, the first digit (position 0) must be non-zero, because the length is 3>1.

So, the DP can check, for each position, whether the current position is the first digit of a number with length >1. If so, the digit must be non-zero.

So, the state can be:

dp[pos][prev][is_tight][started]

Where 'started' is a boolean indicating whether the number has started (i.e., the first non-zero digit has been added).

But for the first digit of a number with length >1, 'started' must be True, and the digit must be non-zero.

So, during the transitions:

At position 0:

   if the number's length is 1:

       digits can be 0-9 (but following the other constraints).

   else:

       digits must be 1-9 (non-zero), and the started flag is True.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, during the transitions, for each position, we can check if it's the first digit of a number with length >1. If so, the digit must be non-zero.

So, for example, if the number's length is 3, then at position 0, the digit must be non-zero (since the length is >1). At position 1 and 2, the digits can be 0-9, but must follow the stepping rule.

So, the DP can track the current position and whether the number has started (i.e., whether the first non-zero digit has been added). For the first position of a number with length >1, the digit must be non-zero.

So, the state is:

dp[pos][prev][is_tight][started]

The transitions are:

For each state (pos, prev, is_tight, started):

   if pos == len(N):

       if started is True:

           return 1

       else:

           return 0 (if the number is 0 and len(N) is 1, but started is False)

   else:

       if pos == 0 and len(N) > 1 and not started:

           digits can be 1-9 (non-zero), and must be <= N[0] if is_tight.

       elif pos ==0 and len(N) ==1:

           digits can be 0-9.

       else:

           if started is False:

               digits can be 0-9, but must be non-zero to start.

           else:

               digits must differ by 1 from prev.

       for each possible d:

           if pos ==0 and len(N) >1 and not started:

               if d ==0:

                   continue (since first digit must be non-zero)

               else:

                   new_started = True

                   new_prev = d

                   new_is_tight = (d == N[pos]) if is_tight else False

                   proceed.

           else:

               if started is False:

                   if d ==0:

                       new_started = False

                       new_prev = None

                       new_is_tight = (d == N[pos]) if is_tight else False

                       proceed.

                   else:

                       new_started = True

                       new_prev = d

                       new_is_tight = (d == N[pos]) if is_tight else False

                       proceed.

               else:

                   if abs(d - prev) !=1:

                       continue

                   new_prev = d

                   new_is_tight = (d == N[pos]) if is_tight else False

                   new_started = True

                   proceed.

But this is getting very complicated. Perhaps there's a better way.

Alternatively, the DP can be split into two parts: numbers with length 1 and numbers with length >1.

For numbers with length 1:

   All digits from 0 to 9 are allowed (but 0 is allowed only if the number is 0).

For numbers with length >1:

   The first digit must be non-zero, and each subsequent digit must differ by 1 from the previous.

So, the total count is the sum of:

   count of valid numbers with length 1 (0-9) that are <= N.

   count of valid numbers with length >1 that are <= N.

But how to compute this.

But the problem is that N can have any length, and the numbers can have varying lengths. So, the approach would be to compute for each possible length from 1 to len(N), the count of valid numbers of that length that are <= N.

But for numbers with length less than len(N), they are all valid (as long as they are stepping numbers and have no leading zeros).

So, the steps would be:

1. Compute the count of stepping numbers with length < len(N). For each length l from 1 to len(N)-1:

   a. For l=1: count all digits 0-9 (but 0 is allowed only if l=1 and the number is 0).

   b. For l>1: count all numbers of length l that are stepping numbers and have no leading zeros.

2. Compute the count of stepping numbers with length == len(N) that are <= N.

The total count is the sum of these two parts.

But how to compute part 1 and part 2.

For part 1:

For l=1:

   The count is 10 (digits 0-9). But wait, according to the problem's note, a stepping number should not have leading zeros. So, for l=1, 0 is allowed. So, the count is 10.

But wait, the problem's note says that a stepping number should not have leading zeros. So, for l=1, 0 is allowed (since it's a single digit), but for l>1, the first digit must be non-zero.

So, for l=1, the count is 10 (0-9).

For l>1:

   The first digit can be 1-9. The second digit must differ by 1 from the first. The third digit must differ by 1 from the second, and so on.

So, the count for l>1 is 9 * 2^(l-2). Because the first digit has 9 options (1-9), and each subsequent digit has 2 options (prev+1 or prev-1), except when the previous digit is 0 or 9, in which case there's only 1 option.

Wait, no. For example, if the first digit is 1, the next can be 0 or 2. If the next is 0, then the following digit can only be 1. If the next is 2, the following can be 1 or 3. So, the number of options depends on the previous digit.

So, the count for l>1 is not a simple formula. So, we need to compute it using dynamic programming.

So, for part 1, the count for l=1 is 10, and for l>1, we need to compute the number of stepping numbers of length l with no leading zeros.

But for part 1, the numbers are of length l < len(N), so they are all less than N. So, the count for part 1 is the sum for l=1 to len(N)-1 of the count of stepping numbers of length l.

For part 2, the count is the number of stepping numbers of length len(N) that are <= N.

So, the total count is part1 + part2.

But how to compute part1 and part2.

For part1:

For l=1: 10.

For l>1: for each l from 2 to len(N)-1, compute the number of stepping numbers of length l with no leading zeros.

This can be done using a DP that tracks the previous digit and the current position.

For example, for l=2:

The first digit can be 1-9. The second digit must differ by 1 from the first. So, for each first digit d (1-9), there are 2 options (d-1 and d+1), except when d is 1 (can have 0 and 2) or 9 (can have 8).

So, the count for l=2 is 9 * 2 - 2 (since 1 and 9 have one option each). Wait, no. For d=1, the next digit can be 0 or 2 (2 options). For d=9, next can be 8 (1 option). For other digits (2-8), next can be d-1 or d+1 (2 options). So, the total is (8 digits * 2) + 1 (for d=9) + 2 (for d=1) → 8*2=16 + 1+2=3 → 19? No, wait:

Wait, for d=1: 2 options (0, 2).

For d=2: 1 and 3 → 2 options.

...

For d=8: 7 and 9 → 2 options.

For d=9: 8 → 1 option.

So, the total is (8 digits from 2-8) * 2 + 2 (for d=1) + 1 (for d=9) → 8*2=16 + 2+1=3 → 19.

So, for l=2, the count is 19.

But this approach is not scalable for large l. So, we need a DP approach.

The DP for part1 (l>1) can be:

dp[l][d] = number of stepping numbers of length l, starting with digit d.

For l=1, dp[1][d] = 1 for d in 0-9.

For l>1:

dp[l][d] = sum of dp[l-1][d-1] + dp[l-1][d+1], but only if d-1 and d+1 are valid digits (0-9).

But for the first digit, d must be 1-9.

So, for part1, the count for l>1 is sum over d=1-9 of dp[l][d], where dp[l][d] is computed as follows:

dp[1][d] = 1 for d=0-9.

For l >=2:

dp[l][d] = (dp[l-1][d-1] if d-1 >=0 else 0) + (dp[l-1][d+1] if d+1 <=9 else 0)

But for the first digit, d must be 1-9. So, for l>1, the first digit is d (1-9), and the rest of the digits are computed based on the previous digit.

So, the total count for part1 (l>1) is sum_{d=1 to 9} dp[l][d], where dp[l][d] is computed as above.

But for l up to 100, this is manageable.

But for part1, the sum is for l from 2 to len(N)-1. So, if len(N) is up to 100, this is feasible.

For part2, the count is the number of stepping numbers of length len(N) that are <= N.

This can be computed using a digit DP approach, as discussed earlier.

So, the overall approach is:

1. Compute part1: sum of stepping numbers of length 1 to len(N)-1.

   a. For l=1: 10.

   b. For l>1: sum over d=1-9 of dp[l][d], where dp[l][d] is computed using the DP described.

2. Compute part2: the number of stepping numbers of length len(N) that are <= N.

3. The total count is (part1 + part2) mod 1e9+7.

But wait, the problem requires the count of stepping numbers in the range [low, high]. So, the function to compute the count up to high is part1 + part2 for high. Similarly for low-1.

But how to compute low-1 when low is a string.

So, the steps are:

Compute f(high) = count of stepping numbers <= high.

Compute g(low-1) = count of stepping numbers <= low-1.

The answer is (f(high) - g(low-1)) mod 1e9+7.

So, the main challenge is to implement the digit DP for part2 (numbers of the same length as N and <= N), and the part1 counts.

But how to compute part1 for l up to 100.

But for l up to 100, the DP for part1 can be precomputed.

But for l=100, the DP would require a 100x10 table, which is manageable.

So, the plan is:

Implement a function count_stepping_numbers_upto(n_str) that returns the count of stepping numbers <= n_str.

This function will compute part1 and part2.

But how to implement this.

Alternatively, the function can be split into:

count_upto(n_str):

   part1 = sum of stepping numbers of length 1 to len(n_str)-1.

   part2 = count_stepping_numbers_same_length(n_str)

   return (part1 + part2) % MOD

But how to compute part1 and part2.

So, the code will have:

- A memoization table for the part1 counts.

- A digit DP function for part2.

But let's think about the code structure.

First, the part1 counts:

For part1, for each l from 1 to len(n_str)-1:

   if l ==1: add 10.

   else: add the sum of dp[l][d] for d in 1-9.

So, we can precompute a DP table for part1.

But for l up to 100, this is feasible.

The DP for part1 can be computed as follows:

Initialize a 2D array dp_prev where dp_prev[d] is the number of stepping numbers of length 1 ending with digit d.

For l=1, dp_prev[d] = 1 for all d in 0-9.

For l>1:

   create a new array dp_current.

   for d in 0-9:

       dp_current[d] = (dp_prev[d-1] if d-1 >=0 else 0) + (dp_prev[d+1] if d+1 <=9 else 0)

   dp_prev = dp_current

   sum the values for d in 1-9 and add to part1.

But for l up to 100, this is manageable.

So, the code for part1 can be:

MOD = 10**9 +7

def compute_part1(max_length):

    if max_length <1:

        return 0

    part1 =0

    if max_length >=1:

        part1 +=10

    if max_length >=2:

        # compute for l from 2 to max_length-1

        # precompute dp for l=2 to max_length-1

        # initial dp for l=1

        dp_prev = [1]*10

        for l in range(2, max_length):

            dp_current = [0]*10

            for d in range(10):

                if d-1 >=0:

                    dp_current[d] += dp_prev[d-1]

                if d+1 <10:

                    dp_current[d] += dp_prev[d+1]

                dp_current[d] %= MOD

            dp_prev = dp_current

            # sum d=1-9

            part1 += sum(dp_prev[1:10]) % MOD

        part1 %= MOD

    return part1

But wait, the max_length is len(n_str). So, part1 is the sum for l from 1 to len(n_str)-1.

So, the code for part1 would be:

max_length = len(n_str)

part1 =0

if max_length >=1:

    part1 +=10

if max_length >=2:

    for l in range(2, max_length):

        # compute dp for l

        # initial dp for l=1 is [1]*10

        # for l=2, compute based on l=1

        # for each l from 2 to max_length-1:

        # compute the sum of dp_prev[1..9]

        # update part1

But this approach would recompute the DP for each l from 2 to max_length-1. But for l up to 100, this is manageable.

Alternatively, precompute the DP for all l up to 100 and store the cumulative sum.

But for the code, it's easier to compute it on the fly.

Now, part2: the count of stepping numbers of length len(n_str) that are <= n_str.

This is done using a digit DP approach, as discussed earlier.

So, the code for part2 is a digit DP function that counts the numbers of the same length as n_str, <= n_str, and are stepping numbers.

The digit DP function will track:

- pos: current position.

- prev: previous digit.

- is_tight: whether the current prefix is exactly the same as n_str's prefix.

- started: whether the number has started (i.e., the first non-zero digit has been added).

But for numbers of the same length as n_str, the first digit must be non-zero (since len(n_str) >1).

So, the digit DP for part2:

The code for the digit DP function would be:

def count_same_length(n_str):

    n = n_str

    length = len(n)

    if length ==0:

        return 0

    MOD = 10**9+7

    from functools import lru_cache

    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)

    def dp(pos, prev, is_tight, started):

        if pos == length:

            return 1 if started else 0

        res =0

        max_digit = int(n[pos]) if is_tight else 9

        for d in range(0, max_digit+1):

            new_is_tight = is_tight and (d == max_digit)

            new_started = started or (d !=0)

            if not started:

                if d ==0:

                    # leading zero, not started yet

                    res += dp(pos+1, None, new_is_tight, new_started)

                    res %= MOD

                else:

                    # started now

                    res += dp(pos+1, d, new_is_tight, new_started)

                    res %= MOD

            else:

                # must differ by 1 from prev

                if abs(d - prev) ==1:

                    res += dp(pos+1, d, new_is_tight, new_started)

                    res %= MOD

        return res % MOD

    return dp(0, None, True, False)

But wait, this code has a problem. For the first digit, if the number's length is 1, then 0 is allowed. But for part2, the length is len(n_str), which is the same as the input. So, if the input is "0", then part2 is 1. But according to the problem's note, 0 is allowed.

But in the code for part2, when the length is 1, the first digit can be 0. So, the code should handle that.

But in the code above, for the first digit (pos=0), if started is False, then d can be 0, which is allowed for length 1.

But for part2, the length is fixed as len(n_str). So, if len(n_str) is 1, then the code allows d=0.

But according to the problem's note, 0 is allowed as a stepping number.

So, the code for part2 should correctly handle this.

But let's test the code for the example 1:

Example 1:

Input: low = "1", high = "11"

Output: 10.

The function count_upto("11") should return 10.

Let's compute part1 and part2.

n_str = "11", len=2.

part1 is the sum for l=1: 10.

part2 is the count of numbers of length 2 that are <=11 and are stepping numbers.

The stepping numbers of length 2 are:

10, 12, 21, 23, 32, 34, 43, 45, 54, 56, 65, 67, 76, 78, 87, 89.

But wait, the numbers must be <=11.

So, the valid numbers are 10 and 12 is 12>11, so not allowed. So, part2 is 1 (only 10).

So, total count is 10 +1 =11. But the example's output is 10. So, there's a mistake.

Wait, the example's output is 10. But according to this, the count_upto("11") would be 10 (part1) +1 (part2) =11. But the example's output is 10. So, this approach is incorrect.

Ah, this indicates a problem with the approach.

Wait, the example's output is 10, which includes numbers from 1 to 11. The stepping numbers are 1-9 (9 numbers), 10 (1 number), total 10.

But according to the approach, part1 is 10 (for l=1), part2 is 1 (for l=2, 10). So, total 11. But the correct answer is 10.

So, the approach is wrong.

What's the problem?

Ah, because part1 includes numbers of length 1 (0-9), but the problem's low is "1", so 0 is not included. So, the function count_upto(high) includes 0, but when we subtract count_upto(low-1), which is count_upto("0"), which includes 0, the result is 10 (11-1=10).

But in the example, the correct answer is 10, which is the count of numbers from 1 to 11. So, the approach is correct, but the example's explanation is missing 0. But according to the problem statement, the example's output is 10, which is correct.

Wait, the example's explanation says the stepping numbers are 1-9 and 10. So, 9+1=10. But according to the approach, count_upto("11") is 10 (part1) +1 (part2) =11. So, there's a discrepancy.

This indicates that the approach is incorrect.

So, what's wrong?

Ah, the part1 for l=1 includes 0, which is not part of the example's range. So, when the function count_upto(high) is called, it includes 0, but when the low is "1", the function count_upto(low-1) is count_upto("0"), which includes 0. So, the difference is 11-1=10, which is correct.

But according to the code's part1, for l=1, the count is 10 (0-9). So, count_upto("11") is 10 (part1) +1 (part2) =11. count_upto("0") is 1 (part1 is 0, part2 is 1 for l=1, which is 0). So, the difference is 11-1=10, which is correct.

So, the code's approach is correct.

But why does the example's part2 for "11" return 1 (only 10 is valid)?

Because the part2 for "11" is the count of numbers of length 2 that are <=11 and are stepping numbers. The valid numbers are 10 and 12. But 12 is 12>11, so only 10 is valid. So, part2 is 1.

So, the code's part2 for "11" returns 1. So, the total count_upto("11") is 10+1=11. But the example's correct answer is 10. So, this indicates a problem.

Wait, but the example's correct answer is 10, which is the count of numbers from 1 to 11. So, the code's approach is including 0 in the count_upto(high), but the example's low is 1, so 0 is excluded. So, the code's approach is correct.

But according to the code's approach, count_upto("11") is 11 (0-9 and 10), and count_upto("0") is 1 (0). So, the difference is 10, which is correct.

So, the code's approach is correct.

But why does the example's part2 for "11" return 1? Because the code's part2 is for numbers of length 2. So, 10 is valid, and 12 is not. So, part2 is 1. So, the code's approach is correct.

So, the code's approach is correct.

But why does the example's output include 10 numbers (1-9 and 10), which is 10 numbers. So, the code's approach is correct.

So, the code's approach is correct.

But how to implement this.

So, the code for the problem is:

Implement the count_upto function as part1 + part2.

But the code for part1 and part2 must be correctly implemented.

So, the code for the problem is:

class Solution:

    def countSteppingNumbers(self, low: str, high: str) -> int:

        MOD = 10**9 +7

        def count_upto(n_str):

            n = n_str

            length = len(n)

            if length ==0:

                return 0

            from functools import lru_cache

        f = count_upto(high)

        # compute low_minus_1 = low -1

        # to compute low_minus_1 as a string:

        def subtract_one(s):

            s_list = list(s)

            i = len(s_list) -1

            while i >=0 and s_list[i] == '0':

                s_list[i] = '9'

                i -=1

            if i <0:

                return '0'

            s_list[i] = str(int(s_list[i])-1)

            if s_list[0] == '0' and len(s_list) >1:

                return s_list[1:]

            return ''.join(s_list)

        low_minus_1 = subtract_one(low)

        g = count_upto(low_minus_1)

        return (f - g) % MOD

But there's a problem with the subtract_one function. For example, if low is "1", then low_minus_1 is "0". If low is "100", then subtract_one returns "99".

But the subtract_one function must handle cases where the number is "0" (but according to the problem's constraints, low is a positive integer, so low_minus_1 can be "0".

So, the code for subtract_one is correct.

But let's test the example 1:

low = "1", high = "11".

count_upto("11") is 10 (part1) +1 (part2) =11.

count_upto("0") is 1 (part1 is 0, part2 is 1 for l=1, which is 0).

So, 11-1=10, which is correct.

Example 2:

Input: low = "90", high = "101"

Output: 2.

The stepping numbers are 98 and 101.

count_upto("101"):

part1: sum for l=1 to 2.

l=1: 10.

l=2: sum of dp_prev[1..9] for l=2.

dp_prev for l=1 is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].

For l=2:

dp_current[d] = sum of dp_prev[d-1] and dp_prev[d+1].

For d=0: dp_prev[-1] (0) + dp_prev[1] (1) → 1.

d=1: dp_prev[0] (1) + dp_prev[2] (1) → 2.

d=2: 1+1=2.

...

d=9: dp_prev[8] (1) + dp_prev[10] (0) →1.

So, sum of d=1-9 for l=2 is:

d=1:2, d=2:2, d=3:2, d=4:2, d=5:2, d=6:2, d=7:2, d=8:2, d=9:1.

Sum is 2*8 +1 =17.

So, part1 for len=3 (high is "101", len=3) is 10 +17 =27.

part2: count of numbers of length 3 <=101 that are stepping numbers.

The valid numbers are 101.

So, part2 is 1.

So, count_upto("101") is 27+1=28.

count_upto("89"):

part1: sum for l=1 to 2.

l=1:10.

l=2:17.

part1 is 27.

part2: count of numbers of length 2 <=89.

The valid numbers are 89, 79, 78, 79, 89, 98, etc. Wait, no. For length 2, the valid numbers are those where the two digits differ by 1.

So, for numbers <=89:

The first digit can be 1-8.

For each first digit d, the second digit can be d-1 or d+1.

So, for d=1: 0,2 → 2 options.

d=2: 1,3 → 2.

...

d=8:7,9 → 2.

So, sum is 8*2=16. But wait, 89 is allowed. So, for d=8, the second digit can be 7 or 9. But 89 is 8 and 9, which differ by 1. So, 89 is allowed.

So, the count for part2 of "89" is 16.

So, count_upto("89") is 27+16=43.

So, the difference is 28-43= -15 mod 1e9+7 is 1e9+7-15=999999992. But the correct answer is 2.

So, this approach is incorrect.

This indicates that the code is not working correctly.

So, there's a mistake in the approach.

The problem is that the part1 and part2 approach is not correct. Because the part1 includes numbers of length < len(n_str), but when the n_str is "101", the part1 includes numbers of length 1 and 2, which are all less than 101. But the part2 includes numbers of length 3 that are <=101. But the code's part2 for "101" is 1 (only 101 is valid). But the correct answer for the example is 2 (98 and 101). So, the code's approach is missing 98.

Ah, because 98 is a number of length 2, which is part of part1. So, in the example, the code's part1 for high="101" includes all numbers of length 1 and 2. So, 98 is part of part1. So, the code's approach is correct.

But in the example, the correct answer is 2 (98 and 101). So, the code's approach would compute count_upto("101") as 27+1=28, and count_upto("89") as 27+16=43. So, 28-43= -15 mod 1e9+7 is 999999992, which is incorrect.

But the correct answer is 2. So, the code's approach is wrong.

This indicates that the approach is incorrect.

So, what's wrong?

Ah, the code's part1 for high="101" includes numbers of length 1 and 2. So, 98 is part of part1. So, the code's approach would count 98 in part1. But in the example, the correct answer is 2 (98 and 101). So, the code's approach would compute count_upto("101") as 28, which includes 98 (part1) and 101 (part2). So, 28- count_upto("89") (43) is 28-43= -15, which is incorrect.

But the correct answer is 2. So, the code's approach is wrong.

This indicates that the approach is incorrect.

So, the problem is that the code's part1 includes numbers of length < len(n_str), but when the high is "101", the part1 includes numbers of length 1 and 2, which are all less than 101. But the code's part1 for high="101" is 10 (l=1) +17 (l=2) =27. But the actual count of stepping numbers of length 1 and 2 is 10 + 17 =27. But in the example, the correct answer is 2 (98 and 101). So, the code's approach is not correct.

But why?

Because the code's part1 for high="101" includes all stepping numbers of length 1 and 2, which are 10+17=27. But the example's correct answer is 2, which is the count of stepping numbers between 90 and 101. So, the code's approach is not correct.

So, the code's approach is incorrect.

This indicates that the initial approach is wrong.

So, what's the correct approach?

The correct approach is to use digit DP for both high and low-1, and compute the difference.

But the digit DP must correctly count all stepping numbers <= N.

So, the initial approach of using digit DP for the entire range is correct, but the code's implementation of the digit DP is incorrect.

So, the problem is in the digit DP function.

In the example 2, the code's part2 for "101" is 1 (only 101 is valid), but the correct part2 should be 1 (101). But the code's part1 for "101" is 27, which includes 98 (part of l=2). So, the code's approach would compute count_upto("101") as 27+1=28. count_upto("89") is 27+16=43. So, 28-43= -15 mod 1e9+7 is 999999992, which is incorrect.

But the correct answer is 2. So, the code's approach is wrong.

So, the problem is that the code's part1 is not correctly counting the stepping numbers of length < len(N).

So, the code's part1 is incorrect.

So, the code's part1 for l=2 is 17, but the actual count of stepping numbers of length 2 is 19 (as computed earlier).

So, the code's part1 is undercounting.

Ah, this is the problem.

In the code's part1 for l=2, the sum of dp_prev[1..9] is 17, but the correct count is 19.

So, the code's part1 is incorrect.

So, the code's DP for part1 is wrong.

So, the code's DP for part1 is not correctly computing the number of stepping numbers of length l.

So, the code's DP for part1 is incorrect.

So, the code's part1 for l=2 is 17, but the correct count is 19.
