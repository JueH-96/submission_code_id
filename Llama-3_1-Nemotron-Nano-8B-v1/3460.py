Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of permutations of [0, 1, ..., n-1] that satisfy all the given requirements. Each requirement says that the prefix up to end_i has exactly cnt_i inversions. Hmm.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. So, for each requirement [end_i, cnt_i], when we look at the permutation perm, the subarray perm[0..end_i] (inclusive) must have exactly cnt_i inversions. And all these requirements must be satisfied simultaneously.

The examples help. Like in example 1, n=3, requirements are [2,2] and [0,0]. The valid permutations are [2,0,1] and [1,2,0]. Let's check why. For the first permutation, the entire array (prefix up to 2) has two inversions. The prefix up to 0 (just the first element) has zero inversions. So both requirements are met. The second permutation also meets both.

So the key is to model the constraints such that all the required end positions and their inversion counts are satisfied. But how do I compute the number of permutations that meet all these constraints?

Let me think about dynamic programming. Because the problem seems to involve building up the permutation step by step and keeping track of certain state variables. The constraints are on the prefixes, so perhaps the DP state can represent the current position and some information about the inversions up to that point.

But the problem is that the requirements can be for any end_i, not necessarily in order. So the requirements might not be sorted by end_i. Wait, but the input says that all end_i are unique. So each end_i is a unique index. So perhaps we can process the requirements in the order of increasing end_i. Because the prefix up to end_i includes all previous prefixes. For example, if there's a requirement for end_i=2 and another for end_i=0, the end_i=0's requirement must be checked first, but since the prefix up to 0 is part of the prefix up to 2, but the requirement for end_i=0 is about the prefix up to 0. So the order in which we process the requirements might not matter as long as we check all of them. But perhaps it's easier to process them in order of increasing end_i.

Wait, but the problem says that the input is generated such that all end_i are unique. So each end_i is unique. So the requirements can be sorted by end_i in increasing order. Then, for each step, when building the permutation, we can check the constraints as we reach each end_i.

But how to model the DP. Let's think: the DP state needs to track the number of inversions in the current prefix, but also the structure of the permutation up to the current position. But that's impossible for n up to 300. So we need a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps the constraints can be transformed into a set of equations that the permutation must satisfy. For example, each requirement [e, c] imposes that the inversion count of the prefix up to e is exactly c. So, for all e in the requirements, the inversion count up to e must be c. But how do these constraints interact with each other?

Another approach: the permutation must satisfy all the constraints. So, for each position e that is an end_i in the requirements, the inversion count up to e must be exactly cnt_i. So, the problem is to count all permutations where certain prefixes have certain inversion counts.

But how to model this. Let's think of the permutation as being built step by step. For each position k (from 0 to n-1), we decide which number to place there. The inversion count up to k depends on the numbers chosen so far and their order.

But inversion count is the number of pairs (i,j) where i < j and perm[i] > perm[j]. So, when adding a new element at position k, the inversion count increases by the number of elements already present that are larger than the new element. Because all those elements are before the new element (since we're building the permutation from left to right), and if they are larger, they form new inversions.

Wait, yes. Let's say we have a permutation of the first k elements. The inversion count is inv. Now, when we add the (k+1)th element (the number not used yet), the new inversion count is inv plus the number of elements already in the permutation that are larger than the new element. Because each such element is before the new one and larger, so each forms a new inversion.

So, the inversion count can be computed incrementally. This is a key insight. So, the DP state can track the current inversion count, and the set of available numbers. But the set of available numbers is too big to track (since n can be 300, the state would be 2^300, which is impossible).

So, we need a way to model the state without tracking the exact elements used. Hmm. Wait, but when building the permutation step by step, the inversion count depends on the elements chosen so far. For example, if the current inversion count is inv, and the next element is x, then the new inversion count is inv + (number of elements already chosen that are larger than x).

But how can we model this without tracking the exact elements? Because the number of elements larger than x in the current permutation depends on the elements chosen. So, perhaps the DP state needs to track the current inversion count and the set of available elements. But that's not feasible for n=300.

Alternative idea: For the DP state, track the current inversion count, and the number of elements that are available which are less than or equal to a certain value. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think differently.

Suppose we have a DP table where dp[k][inv][s] represents the number of ways to arrange the first k elements (positions 0 to k-1) such that the inversion count is inv, and the available elements are those not used yet. But even this is not feasible for n=300, as k can be up to 300, inv can be up to O(k^2), and s is the set of available elements, which is impossible to track.

So, this approach is not feasible. We need a smarter way.

Wait, but the problem requires that certain prefixes (end_i) have exactly cnt_i inversions. So, perhaps the constraints can be checked incrementally as we build the permutation. For example, when building up to position e (which is an end_i), we must have exactly cnt_i inversions. So, the DP can track the inversion count up to the current position, and whenever we reach a required end_i, we check if the inversion count matches cnt_i. If not, that path is invalid.

But how to model this. Let's think of the DP as building the permutation step by step. For each position k (from 0 to n-1), we track the current inversion count. Additionally, we need to track which requirements have been satisfied (i.e., for all end_i <=k, the inversion count must be cnt_i). But since the requirements can have end_i in any order, but the permutation is built in order, perhaps we can process the requirements in the order of their end_i. So, first process the requirement with the smallest end_i, then the next, etc.

Wait, but the requirements can have end_i in any order. For example, a requirement for end_i=2 may come after a requirement for end_i=0. But when building the permutation up to position 2, we need to check both the requirement for end_i=0 and end_i=2. So, perhaps the DP needs to track all the required end_i's and their cnt_i's, and whenever the current position reaches an end_i, check if the inversion count matches.

But how to model this. Let's see. Suppose we have a list of all the end_i's sorted in increasing order. Let's call them e_1, e_2, ..., e_m, where e_1 < e_2 < ... < e_m. Then, as we build the permutation up to position k, whenever k is equal to one of the e_i's, we need to check that the inversion count is exactly cnt_i. If any of these checks fail, the path is invalid.

So, the DP state can be:

dp[k][inv] = number of ways to build the first k elements (positions 0 to k-1) with inversion count inv, and all required end_i's up to k-1 have been satisfied.

Wait, but the required end_i's can be anywhere. For example, if a requirement is for end_i=5, then when we reach position 5 (i.e., after building the first 6 elements, since positions are 0-based?), no, wait. Wait, the permutation is of length n. So, the positions are 0 to n-1. So, the prefix up to end_i is perm[0..end_i], which has (end_i + 1) elements. So, when building the permutation step by step, each step adds one element. So, after step k (0-based), we have placed elements in positions 0 to k. So, the inversion count after step k is the inversion count of the first k+1 elements.

Wait, perhaps the steps are 0-based. For example, when we are at step k, we have placed elements in positions 0 to k. So, the inversion count is for the prefix up to position k. So, when processing a requirement [e, c], we need to check that when we reach step e (i.e., after placing e+1 elements), the inversion count is exactly c.

So, the DP can track the current step (k) and the current inversion count (inv). For each step, when we place a new element, we calculate the new inversion count as inv + the number of elements already present that are larger than the new element.

But how to model the available elements. Because the elements are permutations, each element is unique. So, the available elements are the ones not used yet. But tracking which elements are used is impossible for n=300.

Hmm. So, this seems like a problem that requires a DP approach with state tracking the inversion count and the set of available elements. But that's not feasible for n=300. So, there must be a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the inversion count can be computed based on the order in which elements are inserted, but not their exact values. For example, when inserting a new element, the number of elements larger than it that are already present depends on how many elements are left and their relative sizes. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the DP state as the current inversion count, the number of available elements that are smaller than a certain value, and the number of available elements that are larger. Wait, maybe not. Let's think.

Suppose we have already placed k elements. The available elements are the remaining n - k elements. Let's say the new element we choose is x. The number of elements already present that are larger than x is equal to the number of elements in the current permutation that are larger than x. But since the permutation is built step by step, the current permutation has k elements, and x is one of the remaining elements.

But how can we model this without knowing the exact elements in the permutation? Because the number of elements larger than x in the current permutation depends on which elements have been chosen so far.

This seems tricky. But perhaps there's a way to model the state in terms of the number of available elements and some parameters that allow us to compute the possible contributions to the inversion count.

Wait, here's an idea inspired by some combinatorial approaches. Let's model the DP state as follows:

dp[k][inv][a][b], where:

- k is the number of elements placed so far (positions 0 to k-1).
- inv is the current inversion count.
- a is the number of available elements that are less than some value.
- b is the number of available elements that are greater than some value.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the state can track the number of available elements that are smaller than the next element. Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, think of the available elements as a sorted list. Then, when you choose an element x, the number of elements already present that are larger than x is equal to the number of elements in the current permutation that are larger than x. But since the current permutation is built step by step, the elements in the permutation are a subset of the available elements. But how to track this.

Wait, here's a different approach. Let's model the DP state as the current inversion count, and the set of available elements. But since the available elements are a subset of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, and the order in which they are chosen affects the inversion count, this seems impossible for n=300.

But perhaps there's a way to model the available elements in a way that captures the necessary information for the inversion count. For example, when choosing a new element x, the number of elements already present that are larger than x is equal to the number of elements in the current permutation that are larger than x. But since the current permutation is a subset of the available elements, perhaps we can track the count of available elements that are smaller than x and larger than x. Wait, but x is part of the available elements. So, when we choose x, the remaining available elements are the previous available elements minus x.

Hmm. Let's think: when we have a set S of available elements, and we choose x from S. Then, the number of elements in the current permutation that are larger than x is equal to the number of elements in the permutation that are larger than x. But the permutation is built step by step, and the elements in the permutation are those not in S. So, the permutation up to step k is a subset of the elements not in S. Wait, no. Wait, the permutation is built by choosing elements one by one. So, at step k, we have chosen k elements (positions 0 to k-1), and the available elements are the remaining n - k elements. So, when we choose x as the next element (step k), x is from the available elements (n - k elements). The number of elements already in the permutation (positions 0 to k-1) that are larger than x is equal to the number of elements in the permutation that are larger than x. But how can we compute this without knowing the exact elements in the permutation?

This seems impossible. So, perhaps the problem requires a different approach. Let's think about the constraints again. The problem requires that for certain end positions, the inversion count is exactly a given value. So, perhaps the constraints can be used to form a system of equations that the permutation must satisfy, and the DP can track the necessary information to check these constraints.

But how to model this. Let's consider that the permutation must satisfy all the constraints. So, for each requirement [e, c], the inversion count up to e must be exactly c. So, during the process of building the permutation, whenever we reach position e, we must check that the inversion count is c. If any of these checks fail, the path is invalid.

So, the DP can track the current position (k), the current inversion count (inv), and the set of available elements. But again, the set of available elements is too large to track. So, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: Since the problem requires that all the constraints are satisfied, perhaps the constraints can be ordered by their end_i in increasing order. Then, during the DP, whenever we reach an end_i, we must check that the inversion count is exactly cnt_i. So, the DP can track the current inversion count and the current position. For each step, when we reach a required end_i, we check if the inversion count matches cnt_i. If not, we discard that path.

But how to model the available elements. Because the inversion count depends on the elements chosen so far. So, even if the inversion count is correct up to a certain end_i, the elements chosen may affect the inversion count in future steps.

Wait, but the inversion count is a cumulative value. For example, the inversion count up to end_i is c_i. Then, when building beyond end_i, the inversion count can increase based on the elements added after end_i. So, the constraints are on the inversion count at specific positions, but the elements chosen after those positions can affect the inversion count of later positions.

But the problem is that the inversion count is a global property of the permutation. So, the constraints are on the inversion count of certain prefixes, which are built incrementally. So, the DP must track the inversion count up to the current position, and whenever a required end_i is reached, check that the inversion count is correct.

But the problem is that the inversion count depends on the elements chosen so far, which are not tracked in the DP state. So, how can we model this?

Wait, perhaps the key is to model the DP state as the current position, the current inversion count, and the set of available elements. But for n=300, the set of available elements is 300 elements, which is impossible to track. So, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative approach: Let's think of the problem in terms of generating functions or combinatorial mathematics. For each step, the number of ways to choose the next element and update the inversion count. But how?

Suppose we have a DP table where dp[k][inv] represents the number of ways to arrange the first k elements (positions 0 to k-1) with an inversion count of inv. Then, for each step k, when adding the k-th element (position k), we can choose any of the remaining elements. For each possible element x, the new inversion count is inv + the number of elements already in the permutation that are larger than x. But since we don't track the elements, we can't compute this directly.

But perhaps we can find a way to model the number of elements larger than x in the current permutation based on the available elements. Let's see. Suppose we have m available elements. When we choose x as the next element, the number of elements in the current permutation (size k) that are larger than x is equal to the number of elements in the permutation that are larger than x. But since the permutation is built from the available elements, perhaps we can track the count of available elements that are smaller than x and larger than x. Wait, but x is part of the available elements. So, when we choose x, the remaining available elements are m-1 elements, and the number of elements larger than x in the current permutation is the number of elements in the permutation (k elements) that are larger than x. But how to model this.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of elements larger than x in the current permutation can be determined by the number of available elements that are larger than x and have not been chosen yet. Wait, no. Because the current permutation is made up of elements that were chosen before x. So, the elements in the permutation are the ones not in the available elements. So, the available elements are the ones not yet chosen. So, when we choose x, the elements in the permutation are the ones that were chosen in previous steps, which are not in the available elements. So, the number of elements in the permutation that are larger than x is equal to the number of elements in the available elements (before choosing x) that are larger than x and have not been chosen yet. Wait, no. Because the available elements are the ones not yet chosen. So, the elements in the permutation are the ones that were chosen in previous steps, which are the complement of the available elements. So, the number of elements in the permutation that are larger than x is equal to the total number of elements larger than x in the entire set (0 to n-1) minus the number of available elements larger than x (before choosing x). Because the available elements are the ones not in the permutation. So, if x is chosen now, the elements in the permutation that are larger than x are (total_larger_than_x) - (available_larger_than_x). Because available_larger_than_x is the number of elements larger than x that are still available (not chosen yet). So, the elements in the permutation that are larger than x are the total_larger_than_x minus the available_larger_than_x (since those are the ones not chosen yet, so they are in the available elements, not the permutation).

Wait, let's clarify. The total number of elements larger than x is (n-1 - x), since the elements are 0 to n-1. So, for example, if x is 2 and n=5, there are 2 elements (3,4) larger than x.

But when we are at step k, the available elements are the ones not chosen yet. So, the available elements are a subset of the entire set. So, the number of elements in the permutation (already chosen) that are larger than x is equal to (total_larger_than_x) - (number of available elements larger than x before choosing x). Because the available elements larger than x are those that are not in the permutation. So, the permutation's elements larger than x are the total minus those available.

So, when choosing x as the next element, the number of elements in the permutation that are larger than x is (total_larger_than_x) - (available_larger_than_x). Then, the new inversion count is inv + (total_larger_than_x - available_larger_than_x).

But how can we track available_larger_than_x? Because the available elements are the ones not chosen yet, and x is part of them. So, when we choose x, the available elements after this step are the previous available elements minus x.

But how to model this in the DP state. The problem is that the available elements are not tracked, but their counts (like how many are larger than x) are needed. So, perhaps the DP state can track the current inversion count, and for each possible x, track how many elements are available that are larger than x. But that's not feasible for large n.

Alternatively, perhaps the DP state can track the current inversion count and the number of available elements that are less than or equal to a certain value. But I'm not sure.

Wait, here's a possible approach. Let's model the DP state as follows:

dp[k][inv][c], where:

- k is the number of elements placed so far (positions 0 to k-1).
- inv is the current inversion count.
- c is a list where c[i] represents the number of available elements that are less than i. Or perhaps, the counts of available elements in certain ranges.

But even this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the DP state can track the current inversion count and the number of available elements that are less than a certain value. For example, when choosing x, the number of elements in the permutation that are larger than x is (total_larger_than_x) - (available_larger_than_x). So, if we can track the number of available elements larger than x, we can compute the contribution to the inversion count.

But how to track this. Let's think: when we have m available elements, and we choose x, the number of available elements larger than x is (m - the number of available elements <= x). So, if we can track the number of available elements <= x, then we can compute the required value.

But how to track this. For example, when we have a set of available elements, the number of elements <= x is the count of elements in the available set that are <= x. But since the available elements are not tracked, we need to model this in the DP state.

Alternatively, perhaps the DP state can track the number of available elements and the number of available elements that are less than or equal to a certain value. But for n=300, this is not feasible.

Wait, but perhaps the available elements can be represented by their ranks. For example, when building the permutation, the available elements are a subset of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The key is that when choosing the next element, the number of elements larger than it in the current permutation depends on how many of the available elements are larger than it. So, if we can track, for each possible x, how many available elements are larger than x, then we can compute the contribution to the inversion count.

But how to model this. Let's think: when we have a set of available elements S, and we choose x from S. The number of elements in the permutation (already chosen) that are larger than x is equal to (total_larger_than_x) - (number of elements in S larger than x). Because the total_larger_than_x is the number of elements in the entire set larger than x, and the elements in S are the available ones (not in the permutation). So, the elements in the permutation that are larger than x are total_larger_than_x minus the number of available elements larger than x.

So, if we can track, for each possible x, the number of available elements larger than x, then we can compute the contribution. But how to track this in the DP state.

Alternatively, perhaps the DP state can track the number of available elements and the number of available elements that are less than or equal to a certain value. For example, for each possible x, the number of available elements <= x. But this is not feasible for large n.

Alternatively, perhaps the DP state can track the number of available elements and the number of available elements that are less than the next element. But since the next element is not known in advance, this is not possible.

Hmm. This seems like a dead end. Let's think of another approach.

Another idea: The problem requires that certain prefixes have exactly a certain number of inversions. So, the constraints are on the inversion count at specific positions. So, perhaps the DP can track the current inversion count and the current position, and whenever a required end_i is reached, check if the inversion count matches cnt_i. If not, the path is invalid.

But the problem is that the inversion count depends on the elements chosen so far, which are not tracked. So, how can we model the inversion count correctly?

Wait, but the inversion count is a function of the elements chosen so far and their order. So, the inversion count is not just a function of the current position and the inversion count, but also of the elements chosen. So, the DP state must track the inversion count and the elements chosen. But this is impossible for n=300.

So, this suggests that the problem requires a different approach. Let's think of the problem in terms of the constraints. The constraints are on the inversion counts of certain prefixes. So, perhaps the permutation must satisfy a set of equations on the inversion counts. For example, for each requirement [e, c], the inversion count up to e is c. So, the problem is to count the number of permutations that satisfy all these equations.

But how to model this. Let's think of the permutation as a sequence of elements, and the inversion count is a function of the sequence. The constraints are on certain prefixes of this sequence.

But how to count the permutations that meet all the constraints. This seems like a problem that could be approached with inclusion-exclusion, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming where the state tracks the current position, the current inversion count, and the set of available elements. But for n=300, this is impossible. So, there must be a way to compress the state.

Wait, here's a key observation: the inversion count of a permutation can be computed as the sum over each element of the number of elements to its right that are smaller than it. So, when building the permutation from left to right, each new element contributes to the inversion count based on the elements already present. So, the inversion count is additive in this way.

So, when adding a new element x at position k, the number of inversions added is the number of elements already in the permutation (positions 0 to k-1) that are larger than x. So, the inversion count after adding x is inv_prev + (number of elements in the permutation larger than x).

But how to compute this number without knowing the elements in the permutation. The elements in the permutation are the ones not in the available elements. So, the available elements are the ones not yet chosen. So, the number of elements in the permutation larger than x is equal to (total_larger_than_x) - (number of available elements larger than x). Because total_larger_than_x is the number of elements in the entire set larger than x, and the available elements larger than x are those not yet chosen (so they are in the available elements, not the permutation).

So, if we can track the number of available elements larger than x for each possible x, then we can compute the contribution to the inversion count. But how to track this.

Wait, but when we choose x as the next element, the available elements after this step are the previous available elements minus x. So, the number of available elements larger than x before choosing x is (available_larger_than_x). After choosing x, the available elements are S \ {x}, so the number of available elements larger than x is (available_larger_than_x - 1) if x was larger than some elements. Wait, no. If x is chosen, then the available elements larger than x are those in S that are larger than x, minus x if x is in S. But x is being chosen, so it's removed from the available elements. So, the number of available elements larger than x after choosing x is (available_larger_than_x) - (if x is in S, then x is removed, but x is not larger than itself). So, the available elements larger than x after choosing x is (available_larger_than_x) - (number of elements in S larger than x and not x). Wait, no. The available elements larger than x are the elements in S that are larger than x. When we choose x, we remove x from S. So, the new available elements larger than x are the same as before, minus any elements equal to x (but x is not larger than itself). So, the count remains the same. So, the available_larger_than_x after choosing x is the same as before, except that x is no longer in the available elements. But since x is not larger than itself, the count of available elements larger than x is the same as before.

Wait, this is confusing. Let's take an example. Suppose the available elements are [1, 3, 4], and x is 3. The available elements larger than x are 4. So, available_larger_than_x is 1. After choosing x=3, the available elements are [1,4]. The available_larger_than_x is now 1 (element 4). So, the count remains the same. So, when we choose x, the available_larger_than_x for other elements may change, but for x itself, it's not affected.

So, the key is that when we choose x, the available_larger_than_x for other elements may change. For example, if we have available elements [2,3,4], and we choose 2. Then, the available elements larger than 2 are 3 and 4. But after choosing 2, the available elements are [3,4], and the available_larger_than_3 is 1 (4), and available_larger_than_4 is 0.

So, the available_larger_than_x for other elements depends on the elements chosen. So, this suggests that the DP state must track the available elements in some way. But for n=300, this is impossible.

So, this seems like a dead end. But perhaps there's a way to model the available elements in terms of their counts. For example, track the number of available elements less than or equal to a certain value. Let's think.

Suppose we have a sorted list of available elements. For example, sorted_available = sorted(S). Then, when we choose x, the number of elements in the permutation larger than x is (total_larger_than_x) - (number of elements in sorted_available larger than x). So, if we can track the number of available elements larger than x, we can compute the contribution to the inversion count.

But how to track this. Let's think of the available elements as a sorted list. Then, for each possible x in the available elements, the number of elements larger than x is the number of elements in the sorted list after x. So, if the sorted list is [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{m-1}], then for x = a_i, the number of elements larger than x is m - i - 1.

But how to model this in the DP state. The problem is that the sorted list of available elements can change as elements are chosen. So, the DP state would need to track the sorted list, which is not feasible for m up to 300.

Alternative idea: The key is that the order in which elements are chosen affects the inversion count. But perhaps the number of ways to choose the next element and update the inversion count can be computed based on the number of available elements and their relative sizes.

For example, suppose we have m available elements. When choosing the next element, the number of ways to choose an element x that contributes a certain number of inversions. For each possible x, the contribution to the inversion count is (number of elements in the permutation larger than x) = (total_larger_than_x) - (number of available elements larger than x). So, if we can track the number of available elements larger than x for each x, we can compute the contribution.

But how to track this. Let's think of the available elements as a multiset. For each possible x in the available elements, the number of available elements larger than x is known. But this is not feasible to track for large n.

Another approach: Let's model the DP state as the current inversion count, the number of available elements, and the number of available elements that are less than or equal to a certain value. For example, for each possible value v, track how many available elements are <= v. But this is not feasible for large n.

Alternatively, perhaps the DP state can track the current inversion count and the number of available elements that are less than or equal to the next element. But since the next element is not known, this is not possible.

Hmm. This is getting really stuck. Let's think of the problem from another angle. The problem requires that certain prefixes have exactly a certain number of inversions. So, the constraints are on the inversion count at specific positions. The DP must track the inversion count up to the current position and ensure that all constraints are met.

But the inversion count depends on the elements chosen so far. So, the DP state must track the inversion count and the elements chosen. But this is impossible for n=300.

Wait, but perhaps the constraints can be used to limit the possible inversion counts. For example, if a requirement [e, c] exists, then when we reach position e, the inversion count must be exactly c. So, during the DP, whenever we reach position e, we can only proceed if the inversion count is c. This way, the DP can prune paths that do not meet the constraints.

But again, the problem is that the inversion count depends on the elements chosen, which are not tracked. So, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: Let's precompute all possible inversion counts for each possible prefix and track the constraints. But for n=300, this is impossible.

Wait, but the constraints are given as part of the input. So, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a system of equations where the inversion count at certain positions must equal certain values. For example, the inversion count at position e must be c. So, the problem is to count the number of permutations that satisfy all these equations.

But how to model this. The inversion count is a function of the permutation. So, the problem is to count the number of permutations that satisfy all the equations. But how to compute this.

Another observation: The inversion count of a permutation is the same as the number of inversions in the permutation. So, the problem is to count the number of permutations where certain prefixes have a certain number of inversions.

But how to model this. Let's think of the permutation as a sequence of elements. For each requirement [e, c], the first e+1 elements must have exactly c inversions. So, the problem is to count the number of such permutations.

But how to model this. Let's think of the permutation as being built step by step. For each step k (0 to n-1), we choose an element to place at position k. The inversion count is updated based on the elements chosen so far.

But again, the problem is that the inversion count depends on the elements chosen, which are not tracked in the DP state.

So, this seems like a dead end. But perhaps there's a way to model the DP state with the current inversion count and the number of available elements that are larger than a certain value. For example, when choosing the next element, the number of available elements larger than x is known based on the current state.

Wait, here's a possible approach inspired by some combinatorial mathematics. Let's model the DP state as follows:

dp[k][inv][m], where:

- k is the number of elements placed so far (positions 0 to k-1).
- inv is the current inversion count.
- m is a list where m[i] represents the number of available elements that are less than i. Or perhaps, m is a sorted list of available elements.

But this is not feasible for large n.

Alternatively, perhaps the DP state can track the current inversion count and the number of available elements that are less than or equal to a certain value. For example, for each possible value v, track how many available elements are <= v. But this is not feasible for large n.

Another idea: The number of available elements that are larger than x is equal to the number of elements in the available set that are greater than x. So, if we can track the available elements as a sorted list, then for any x, the number of elements larger than x can be found using binary search. But again, tracking the sorted list is not feasible for large n.

Hmm. This is really challenging. Let's think of the problem in terms of the example.

Example 1: n=3, requirements = [[2,2], [0,0]]. The valid permutations are [2,0,1] and [1,2,0]. Let's see how the inversion counts are built.

For [2,0,1]:

- After step 0 (element 2), inversion count is 0 (no elements after it).
- After step 1 (element 0), inversion count increases by 1 (since 2 > 0). So, inversion count is 1.
- After step 2 (element 1), inversion count increases by 1 (since 2 > 1). So, inversion count is 2.

But the requirement for end_i=2 is 2, which is met. The requirement for end_i=0 is 0, which is also met.

For [1,2,0]:

- After step 0 (element 1), inversion count is 0.
- After step 1 (element 2), inversion count increases by 0 (no elements larger than 2 in the permutation so far). So, inversion count remains 0.
- After step 2 (element 0), inversion count increases by 2 (both 1 and 2 are larger than 0). So, inversion count is 2.

So, the requirements are met.

So, the inversion count is built incrementally, and the constraints are checked at certain positions.

But how to model this in the DP. Let's think of the DP state as the current position (k), the current inversion count (inv), and the set of available elements. But for n=300, this is impossible.

But perhaps there's a way to model the available elements in a way that allows us to compute the number of elements larger than x. For example, the available elements can be represented by their ranks. Let's say we have m available elements. The ranks are the sorted order of the available elements. So, the smallest available element is rank 0, the next is rank 1, etc. Then, when we choose an element from the available elements, the number of elements larger than it is m - (rank + 1). Because the available elements are sorted, and the chosen element is at rank r, so there are m - r - 1 elements larger than it.

But how to track the ranks of the available elements. Because the ranks change as elements are chosen. For example, if the available elements are [1,3,4], their ranks are 0,1,2. If we choose 3, the new available elements are [1,4], which have ranks 0 and 1.

But tracking the ranks of the available elements is equivalent to tracking the sorted list of available elements, which is not feasible for large m.

So, this approach is not feasible.

Another idea: The number of ways to choose the next element and update the inversion count can be computed based on the number of available elements and their relative sizes. For example, when there are m available elements, the number of elements that would contribute a certain number of inversions when chosen next can be determined based on their relative sizes.

But how to model this. Let's think: when there are m available elements, the next element can be any of them. For each possible element x, the number of elements in the permutation larger than x is (total_larger_than_x) - (number of available elements larger than x). So, the contribution to the inversion count is (total_larger_than_x) - (available_larger_than_x).

But how to compute this for all possible x in the available elements. The total_larger_than_x is known for each x (since x is in 0..n-1). The available_larger_than_x is the number of available elements larger than x.

But the available elements are not tracked, so we can't compute available_larger_than_x for each x. So, this approach is not feasible.

Hmm. This seems like a very challenging problem. Let's think of possible ways to model the DP state.

Another observation: The inversion count is additive. Each new element contributes a certain number of inversions based on the elements already present. So, the inversion count can be computed incrementally. But the problem is that the contribution depends on the elements chosen so far.

But perhaps the contribution can be modeled in terms of the available elements. For example, when choosing x as the next element, the contribution is the number of elements in the permutation (already chosen) that are larger than x. Which is equal to (total_larger_than_x) - (number of available elements larger than x). So, if we can track the number of available elements larger than x for each x, we can compute the contribution.

But how to track this. Let's think of the available elements as a sorted list. Then, for any x in the available elements, the number of elements larger than x is the number of elements in the sorted list that are after x. So, if the available elements are sorted, then for x at position i in the sorted list, the number of elements larger than x is m - i - 1, where m is the number of available elements.

But how to model this in the DP state. The sorted list of available elements is not tracked, but perhaps we can track the number of available elements and the number of available elements that are less than or equal to a certain value. For example, for each possible value v, track how many available elements are <= v. This way, for any x, the number of available elements larger than x is m - count_le(x), where count_le(x) is the number of available elements <= x.

But how to track count_le(x) for all x. This is not feasible for large n. But perhaps we can track the sorted list of available elements in a compressed way. For example, track the sorted list as a list of intervals or a binary search tree. But this would require a lot of memory and is not feasible for n=300.

Alternatively, perhaps the available elements can be represented by their ranks. For example, the available elements are sorted, and we track the ranks of the available elements. But again, this is not feasible for large m.

Hmm. This is really challenging. Let's think of the problem from another angle. The problem requires that certain prefixes have exactly a certain number of inversions. So, the constraints are on the inversion count at certain positions. The DP must track the inversion count and ensure that all constraints are met. But the inversion count depends on the elements chosen so far.

So, perhaps the key is to model the DP state as the current position, the current inversion count, and the set of available elements. But for n=300, this is impossible. So, there must be a way to compress the state.

Wait, here's a possible breakthrough. The inversion count is determined by the order in which elements are inserted. So, the inversion count can be computed as the sum of the number of elements already present that are larger than the current element. So, when inserting elements in a certain order, the inversion count is the sum of the contributions from each element.

But the problem is that the order of insertion affects the inversion count. So, the same set of elements inserted in different orders can result in different inversion counts.

But the constraints are on the inversion count of certain prefixes. So, the problem is to count the number of permutations (orders of insertion) that meet all the constraints.

But how to model this. Let's think of the permutation as a sequence of elements. For each requirement [e, c], the first e+1 elements must have exactly c inversions. So, the problem is to count the number of such sequences.

But how to model this. Let's think of the permutation as being built step by step. For each step k (0 to n-1), we choose an element to place at position k. The inversion count is updated based on the elements chosen so far.

But the inversion count depends on the elements chosen so far and their order. So, the DP state must track the inversion count and the elements chosen so far. But this is impossible for n=300.

So, this suggests that the problem requires a different approach. Let's think of the problem in terms of the constraints. The constraints are on the inversion count of certain prefixes. So, the permutation must satisfy a set of equations on the inversion counts. The problem is to count the number of permutations that satisfy all these equations.

But how to model this. Let's think of the permutation as a sequence of elements. The inversion count of the first e+1 elements is c. So, the problem is to count the number of such sequences.

But how to compute this. Let's think of the permutation as a sequence of elements, and the inversion count is a function of the sequence. The constraints are on certain prefixes of the sequence.

But how to count the number of sequences that meet all the constraints. This seems like a problem that could be approached with dynamic programming, but the state must track the necessary information to compute the inversion count.

But again, the state must track the inversion count and the elements chosen so far, which is not feasible for n=300.

Hmm. This is really challenging. Let's think of the problem in terms of the constraints. The constraints are on the inversion count of certain prefixes. So, the permutation must have certain inversion counts at certain positions. The problem is to count the number of such permutations.
