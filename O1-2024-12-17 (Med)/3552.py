        """
        We want the largest n-digit palindrome (no leading zeros) that is divisible by k.
        Because n can be up to 10^5, we cannot simply iterate over all n-digit numbers.
        
        Key idea:
          1) An n-digit palindrome is determined by its "first half" (plus one middle digit if n is odd).
             Let M = (n + 1) // 2 be the length of this half.
             - If n is even, H[0..M-1] mirrored forms the palindrome of length n.
             - If n is odd, H[0..M-2] + [H[M-1]] + reverse(H[0..M-2]) forms the palindrome.
          2) We want the palindrome to be divisible by k (where 1 <= k <= 9).
             We can compute the remainder of the palindrome mod k by looking at
             each digit in the half and its position(s) in the full palindrome.
          3) A more direct method: Start with all 9's in the half (which gives
             a plainly largest string half), then see what the remainder R is.
             We must "reduce" the sum of digits, mod k, to fix that remainder so the
             final palindrome becomes 0 mod k.
          4) We set up a small DP (of size M x k) to find how much we reduce each half-digit
             from 9 (call that reduction d in [0..9]) so that the sum of (d * factor[i]) â‰¡ R (mod k).
             - factor[i] is the "contribution" of H[i] to the palindrome mod k.
             - If we reduce H[i] by d, the digit becomes 9 - d.
             - We pick the smallest d for each position from left to right to keep the overall number largest.
          5) We also ensure the first digit of the half (H[0]) is not zero, i.e. H[0] = 9 - d != 0,
             so d != 9 at i=0. This ensures no leading zero in the final palindrome.
        
        Steps in detail:
          - Compute M = (n+1)//2.
          - Precompute powers-of-10 mod k to build a factor array f of length M:
            f[i] = (10^(leftPos) + 10^(rightPos)) % k for the mirrored digits;
            if n is odd and i == M-1, that digit is the true middle, so f[i] = 10^(middlePos) % k alone.
          - The sum of all '9' digits in H has remainder R = (9 * sum(f[i])) % k.
          - We define a DP table dp with size (M+1) x k, and a parent pointer to reconstruct:
              dp[i][rem] = True  means we can reach remainder 'rem' by choosing reductions
                  for H[:i].
              We want dp[M][R] = True in the end.
          - Transitions:
              dp[0][0] = True
              For i in [0..M-1]:
                for rem in [0..k-1] where dp[i][rem] is True:
                  - if i==0, we skip d=9 (which would make H[0]=0)
                  - else d in [0..9]
                  newRem = (rem + d*f[i]) % k
                  if not dp[i+1][newRem]:
                      dp[i+1][newRem] = True
                      parent[i+1][newRem] = (rem, d)
          - Reconstruct from dp[M][R]: go backward to find how much we reduced each digit.
            Then H[i] = 9 - d.
          - Build the palindrome string from H.
        
        The DP has O(M * k * 10) complexity, which is about 10 * 9 * (n/2) = 45 * (n/2) ~ 22.5n.
        This is borderline but can pass in optimized Python if done carefully.
        We then output the constructed palindrome.
