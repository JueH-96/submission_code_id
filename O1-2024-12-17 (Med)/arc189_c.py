    # 1) Identify the cycle of P that contains X.
    #    We'll store it in cycP (a list of nodes in the order visited),
    #    and also build a dict idxP that maps each node in that cycle to its index in cycP.
    #
    #    Then for each i with A[i] == 1, check if i is in that cycle. If not, impossible.
    #    Otherwise compute the "distance" (number of picks needed) to get from i to X.
    #    Because picking a box moves that color forward by +1 along P (mod cycle length),
    #    the distance from cycP-index(i) to cycP-index(X)=0 is (cycle_length - i_index) mod cycle_length.
    #    We take the maximum over all i with A[i]=1 to get dR.
    #
    # 2) Repeat similarly for Q to get cycQ, idxQ, and dB.
    #
    # 3) If any ball is not in the respective cycle, answer=-1.
    #
    # 4) Otherwise, we compute a possible "synergy" that can reduce the total picks:
    #    - Let CP = set of nodes in cycP, CQ = set of nodes in cycQ.
    #    - If for all u in cycP we have P[u] == Q[u], then red and blue follow exactly the same edges
    #      around that cycle, so synergy = min(dR, dB) (we can move them together every step).
    #    - Else if (CP âˆ© CQ has some node != X) and both dR>0 and dB>0, then synergy=1
    #      (we can at least arrange them to coincide in one box and pick it once for both).
    #    - Otherwise synergy=0.
    #
    # 5) The result = dR + dB - synergy.  And of course it must be >= max(dR,dB).
    #
    # 6) Print the result or -1 if impossible.
