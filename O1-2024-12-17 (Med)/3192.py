        """
        We want to maximize ( (a ^ x) * (b ^ x) ) for 0 <= x < 2^n, 
        and return the result modulo 10^9+7.
        
        Key observations:
          1) For bits â‰¥ n, x has no effect (x < 2^n means x has at most n bits).
             So the top bits of (a^x) and (b^x) are exactly the top bits of a and b.
          2) For bits < n, we control those bits of (a^x) and (b^x) by choosing x.
          3) In particular, (a^x) XOR (b^x) = a XOR b for all x, so for each bit i < n:
               - If a_i == b_i, then (a^x)_i == (b^x)_i.
                 We can choose them both 0 or both 1 by picking x_i appropriately.
               - If a_i != b_i, then (a^x)_i != (b^x)_i.
                 We can choose (1,0) or (0,1) by x_i = 0 or 1.
          4) To maximize the product, it turns out best to set any "same" bits to 1 
             in both (so that both numbers get that bit set).  For "different" bits 
             we must decide whether to give the '1' to (a^x) or to (b^x).  
             We look at which of a or b has larger top half (a>>n vs b>>n). 
             If a>>n > b>>n, we favor making (b^x) bigger.  If b>>n > a>>n, favor (a^x). 
             If they are equal, we distribute these differing bits so that the lower-n-bit
             parts stay as balanced as possible (thus helping the product).
        
        This runs in O(n) and handles up to n=50, a,b<2^50 efficiently.
