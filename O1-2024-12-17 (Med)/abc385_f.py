    # We wish to find the largest nonnegative h such that from (0,h) we do NOT see
    # at least one building. Equivalently, we find the "critical" h above which
    # all buildings become visible, and that boundary is the answer.
    #
    # From earlier reasoning (and verified against the samples), a succinct way
    # to compute that boundary is via:
    #
    #   M_i = max over j < i of  [ (X_i * H_j - X_j * H_i) / (X_i - X_j) ]
    #
    # (If there is no j < i, M_i = -âˆž so building i is unblocked by any to its left.)
    #
    # Then if we let M = max_i(M_i), we can see all buildings only if h > M.
    # Hence the "maximum h that fails to see all" is M.
    # If M <= 0, then even at h=0 we already see all buildings, so answer is -1.
    #
    # The only challenge is to compute these M_i in O(N) or O(N log N) time,
    # because N can be up to 2e5.
    #
    # A known trick (sometimes called a "convex-hull"-like stack method), works
    # in a single pass from left to right (since X is strictly increasing).
    #
    # Define a function overshadow(j, i) = (X_i * H_j - X_j * H_i)/(X_i - X_j).
    # We keep a stack "st" of indices of buildings (in strictly increasing order of X).
    # Each time we consider a new building i, we compute the intersection with the
    # top of the stack, pop while that intersection is not strictly greater than the
    # previous intersection, etc.  This is analogous to the usual "convex hull trick"
    # insertion when lines have strictly decreasing slopes (here slope = -1/X, which
    # is indeed decreasing in X if X is increasing).
    #
    # We record all intersection values in an array "inter", where inter[k] is
    # the vantage-height at which the building st[k+1] first overshadows st[k].
    # The answer is then the maximum of these intersection values.
    #
    # Details:
    #  - overshadow(j, i) can be negative; that simply means for vantage h> that value,
    #    building i is on top.  We only care about the maximum such values that block
    #    visibility.  
    #  - In the end, max(inter) is our M.  If M <= 0, output -1, else M.
    #
    # Let's implement it now.
