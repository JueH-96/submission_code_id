        """
        We want to count how many positive integers x < n (where n is given in binary by s)
        are k-reducible (i.e., applying 'x -> number_of_set_bits(x)' at most k times reduces x to 1).
        
        Observing that each reduction step drastically shrinks x (after the first step, x <= 800 since
        the max length of s is 800, and then further reductions get very small quickly), we can precompute
        how many steps it takes for an integer i <= 800 to become 1 by repeated set-bit counts.

        Then, for each x < n, we only need to know popcount(x) to see if x is k-reducible (because
        f(x) = 0 if x=1, else 1 + f(popcount(x))). We check whether f(x) <= k.

        Because n can have up to 800 bits, we cannot iterate over all x < n directly. Instead, we use a
        digit-DP (bitwise DP) approach to count how many x < n have popcount(x) in a set that leads to
        k-reducibility.

        Steps to solve:
          1) Precompute the steps_needed[i] = "minimum number of popcount operations to reduce i to 1"
             for i in [1..800].
          2) From steps_needed[i], build can_reduce[i][r] = True if i can be reduced to 1 in at most r steps.
          3) We then do a standard binary-DP over the bits of n:
             dp(pos, count_ones, less) = number of ways to form a binary number of length len(s) from index pos
             with 'count_ones' bit-ones so far, and 'less' indicates we are already strictly less than
             the prefix of n at some prior step. At the end, we only count those with count_ones>0
             and can_reduce[count_ones][k-1] == True, and also only if 'less' == 1 (strictly less overall).

        The result is dp(0,0,0), modulo 1e9+7.
