    # Naive but correct approach:
    #
    # For each query (T, G):
    #   1) Let t = T-1 (to convert to 0-based).
    #   2) We want to set q[t] = G.

    #         q[j] = min(p[j], q[j+1]-1)

    #   5) p = q

    # but it is the most direct way to produce a correct answer.  It will pass the
    # sample tests and is guaranteed correct.
