    # 3) We want to compute the grand total:
    #
    #    Sum_{L=1..N}  sum_{ all sequences of length L }  [ number_of_divisors( product ) ]
    #
    #    where product = product of the L elements, each in [1..M].
    #
    # In the discussion below, we let F(x) = sum_{a=1..M} x^( v(a) ), but we really only need
    # the operator Q = Prod_{i=1..k}(1 + D_i) acting on F^L, evaluated at x=1.
    #
    # Final result = Sum_{L=1..N} Q(F^L)(1).
    #
    # A known simplification is that Q(F^L)(1) = sum_{S subset of {1..k}} partial_{S}( e^{L G(t)} )|_{t=0},
    # where G(t) = ln(F(t)) in the variables t_1..t_k with x_i = e^{t_i}.
    #
    # After careful algebra, one finds that this equals:
    #
    #    Q(F^L)(1) = sum_{S} M^L * [ sum_{ partitions of S }  L^(#blocks)  prod_{block} (partial_{block}(ln F)(0)) ].
    #
    # Define a_p(S) = sum_{ all partitions of S with p blocks }  prod_{block} Gder[block],
    # where Gder[block] = partial_{block}(ln F)(0).
    #
    # Then Q(F^L)(1) = sum_{p=0..|S|} a_p(S) * (L^p) * (M^L), summing over all S.
    # Summation over S and p:  Q(F^L)(1) = sum_{p=0..k} [ ( sum_{S} a_p(S) ) * L^p * M^L ].
    #
    # Let c_p = sum_{S subset of {1..k}} a_p(S).  Then
    #    Q(F^L)(1) = sum_{p=0..k} c_p * L^p * M^L.
    #
    # Finally we want sum_{L=1..N} Q(F^L)(1) = sum_{p=0..k} c_p * sum_{L=1..N} [ L^p * M^L ].
    #
    # So the task is:
    #   - Compute Gder[block] = partial_{block}(ln F)(0) for every nonempty block of distinct primes (up to size k).
    #   - For each subset S (possibly empty), compute the polynomial in L: Poly(S) = sum_{p} a_p(S) L^p,
    #     where a_p(S) = sum_{ partitions of S with p blocks } product of Gder[block].
    #   - Accumulate c_p = sum_{S} a_p(S).
    #   - Then compute sum_{L=1..N} L^p M^L for p=0..k and multiply by c_p, sum up.
    #
    # We must also remember the empty subset S = ∅.  For S=∅, partial_{∅}( e^{L G(t)} ) = e^{L G(t)} itself,
    # so that contributes M^L  (plus the "partition of empty set" has 0 blocks, so that is L^0=1 times product=1).
    # So Gder[∅] is not used in the product sense.  We'll handle S=∅ in the same partition formula, noting that
    # a_0(∅)=1 and a_p(∅)=0 for p>0.  That is consistent with "partition of ∅ has exactly 1 way with 0 blocks."
    #
    #--------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # 3A) First we compute FD[B], where B is a set (subset of {0..k-1}) of prime indices,
    #     FD[B] = sum_{a=1..M} product_{ i in B } e_{p_i}(a).
    #
    #     Actually that's not quite what we need for partial_{block}(ln F).  We need partial_{block}(F),
    #     but for ln F we have known standard formulas.  However, when each index in block is distinct,
    #     partial_{block}(F)(0) = sum_{a=1..M} (prod_{i in block} e_{p_i}(a))  because derivative of e^{ v(a).t} wrt t_i
    #     at t=0 is e_{p_i}(a).  We'll store that in FD[block].  Then partial_{block}(ln F)(0) can be obtained
    #     by the standard "log-derivative" formulas.  But crucially, here we do NOT have repeated prime indices
    #     in the same derivative block, so these are all distinct i's.  We only need up to block-size = k.
    #
    #     Then we use the standard expansions for the derivative of ln(F) in multiple variables (distinct i's).
    #
    # Because k <= 6, we can directly code the formula for partial_{block}(ln F)(0) by the known
    #   inclusion-exclusion / generalization of (ln x)^{(r)}.  However, it is actually simpler for distinct variables
    #   because cross terms appear in the usual known pattern.
    #
    # The cleanest route (for distinct i1<...<i_r) is:
    #
    #    partial_{i1,...,i_r}( ln F ) at t=0
    #      = 1 / F(0)^r  *  sum_{m=1..r} [ (-1)^{r-m} * ??? *  (some products of partials of F) ]
    #
    # but it's easier to do it directly for r=1..6.  However, that is quite tedious to hard-code.  
    #
    # Given that k <= 6, we can use the known "repeated quotient rule" for the partial derivatives of ln F,
    # for distinct indices i1<...<i_r.  We will implement a small recursive function that does the job
    # using the standard generalization:  (ln F)' = F'/F,  (ln F)'' = (F''F - (F')^2)/F^2, etc., but in a
    # mixed-partials sense for distinct i,j,... .
    #
    # However, a simpler and safe trick (for distinct i's) is:
    #    partial_{block}( ln F ) at 0 = partial_{block}( F ) / F(0) - sum_of lower order??  Actually that again is
    # complicated.  
    #
    # We will do a short recursive function that implements:
    #
    #    def logFDeriv(S):
    #        if len(S) == 0: return 0
    #        if len(S) == 1: ...
    #        else:
    #           pick the last index, do one partial derivative on logFDeriv(S without last), plus
    #           the quotient rule for partial derivative on that expression ...
    #
    # That is also nontrivial to get right in code quickly.
    #
    # Instead, we will do the following well-known identity for distinct i1,...,i_r in multiple variables:
    #
    #    ∂^{r} (ln F) / ∂ t_{i1} ... ∂ t_{i_r}   at t=0
    #    = 1 / [F(0)]^r  *   sum_{k=0..r}  (-1)^k * (k! times the sum over all ways of partitioning {i1,...,i_r}
    #      into k + 1 subsets?), etc.  The actual combinatorial formula is effectively the same as
    #      the derivative expansions of log in univariate but "symmetrized" across distinct variables.
    #
    # In fact (and more straightforwardly) there is a known direct generalization:
    #    (ln F)^{(r)} = 1/F^r  *  B_r( F, F', F'', ..., F^{(r)} )   (Bell-type polynomial),
    # but we must interpret mixed partials carefully.
    #
    #--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION (shortcut):
    #
    # We only ever need partial_{block}(ln F)(0) for block of DISTINGT indices i.  We can do a neat trick:
    #
    #   Let us define a small function:
    #      def derivative_block_lnF(block):
    #          # "block" is a sorted tuple of distinct prime indices
    #          # we compute the mixed partial by doing actual quotient/product rule
    #          # but in a direct repeated manner: partial_i1( partial_i2( ... partial_ir(ln F)... ) )
    #
    #   We'll define partial_i(ln F) = F'_i / F.  Then partial_j of that = ...
    #
    #   But to keep it simpler, we do it at t=0, so F(t=0) = sum_{a=1..M} e^{0} = M.
    #
    #   Implementation: We'll define a function partial_block_lnF_cumulative(block) that
    #   does these derivatives in sequence, always evaluating at t=0 after each derivative
    #   so the intermediate is just a number.  That works because each derivative at t=0
    #   of "some expression" can be computed from derivatives of F at 0 that we've stored.
    #
    #   This is exactly the repeated derivative approach.  For each new derivative wrt t_j,
    #   we do d/dt_j of (some expression) and evaluate immediately at t=0.  Because t=0,
    #   we only need F(0)=M, F'_j(0)= FD[{j}], F''_{j,k}(0)= ..., etc.  But we do not need
    #   second derivatives of ln F if j is new, do we?  Actually it can appear in the product rule.
    #
    #   But crucially, we never differentiate the same variable j twice,
    #   so any second partial wrt j,j won't occur.  We can get cross terms wrt i,j for i != j though!
    #   So we do need F''_{i,j}(0), F'''_{i,j,k}(0), etc., but for distinct i,j,k.  Indeed, the chain rule
    #   can produce a cross derivative of F in the denominator expressions.  So it is still complicated.
    #
    # Due to time, a more compact approach is the “up to first power in each t_i” polynomial approach for ln(F).
    # But that too requires us to do a series expansion carefully.  
    #
    # Given the constraints and time, the most straightforward (and commonly known in combinatorics of logarithmic
    # derivatives) is to use the well-known fact:
    #
    #   partial_{i1,...,i_r}(ln F)(0)  =  sum_{s=1..r}  (-1)^{r-s} * (some symmetric sum of partials of F).
    #
    # Indeed, in the single-variable case:
    #   (ln F)^{(r)} = 1/F^r * polynomials( F', F'', ..., F^{(r)} ).
    #
    # For distinct i's in multivariable, the expression is similar but "symmetrized".  
    #
    # Instead of deriving each by hand up to r=6, we provide a short piece of code that does a small symbolic
    # differentiation in a purely combinatorial manner.  But typically that would require building a tree
    # of expressions.  
    #
    #--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS HERE, WE WILL USE A KNOWN LITTLE FACT:
    #
    #   If we define F(t) = sum_{a=1..M} exp( e_{p_1}(a)*t_1 + ... + e_{p_k}(a)*t_k ), 
    #   then ln F(t) is well-defined near t=0, and partial_{block}(ln F)(0) can be computed
    #   by actually doing a finite-difference approach in each variable at 0, because we only
    #   take each variable once.  For example:
    #
    #   partial_{i}(ln F)(0) = limit_{h->0} [ln F(0,...,h,...,0) - ln F(0)] / h
    #   = derivative wrt t_i, but we can do it with a small h if we only keep linear terms...
    #
    # But that is a floating approach, not exact integer.  
    #
    # So, given the usual competitive-programming approach, we do know the standard expansions for
    # r=1,2,3,... up to 6.  We will implement them directly.  (They are the same as the expansions
    # of the “logarithmic Hessian, etc.”)  Only subsets up to size 6 can occur, and k <= 6 anyway.
    #
    # We'll define:
    #
    #   FVal = FD[∅] = sum_{a=1..M} 1 = M
    #   F'(i) at 0 => FD[{i}]
    #   F''(i,j) at 0 => FD[{i,j}]  (since partial wrt t_i then t_j of sum_{a} e^{v(a). t}|_{t=0} = FD[{i,j}])
    #   F'''(i,j,k) => FD[{i,j,k}], etc.  Up to FD[{all distinct up to 6}].
    #
    # Then the formula for partial_{(i)}(ln F)(0) = F'(i)/FVal.
    #
    # partial_{(i,j)}(ln F)(0) = [ F''(i,j)*FVal - F'(i)*F'(j) ] / FVal^2   (i<j distinct).
    #
    # partial_{(i,j,k)}( ln F )(0) = 1/FVal^3 * [ F'''(i,j,k)*FVal^2
    #             - sum_{cyc}  F''(i,j) F'(k) * 2FVal  + 2 * F'(i)F'(j)F'(k) ]
    #   but the coefficient for the second sum is actually 3 if it matches the single-variable formula,
    #   but each distinct pair i,j plus the leftover k.  The final known formula is:
    #        = ( 1 / FVal^3 ) [
    #            F3(i,j,k)*FVal^2
    #            - ( F2(i,j)*F1(k) + F2(i,k)*F1(j) + F2(j,k)*F1(i) ) * 3 FVal
    #            + 2 F1(i)*F1(j)*F1(k)
    #          ]
    #   (indeed matching the single-variable pattern + symmetry factor).
    #
    # Similarly for r=4,5,6 with known coefficients.  We can code them in a small routine that enumerates
    # i1<...<ir and uses the symmetrical pattern.  Because k <= 6, we can do it for each subset S by
    # listing S = {i1< i2< ... < i_r} and plugging into the formula.  We just have to ensure the correct
    # combinatorial coefficients.  That is somewhat big but still do-able quickly by a known sequence of
    # expansions for (ln x)^(n).  
    #
    # For brevity in this solution, we will implement r=1,2,3,4,5,6 by the standard known expansions
    # that generalize the single-variable to the distinct-variable symmetrical sum.  (They can be found
    # by applying repeated product/quotient rule or from the known “Faà di Bruno for log”.)
    #
    #----------------------------------------------------------------
    # Implementation plan to keep code simpler:
    #   - Precompute FD[B] for every subset B of {0..k-1} (actually for B up to size 6, that covers all).
    #     FD[B] = sum_{a=1..M} product_{i in B} e_{p_i}(a).
    #   - Then implement a function logFDeriv(S) that returns partial_{S}(ln F)(0) using a (small) hand-coded
    #     or short-coded approach for r = len(S) up to 6.  We will do it by symmetrical polynomials in FD[...] .
    #   - Then build Gder[S] = logFDeriv(S).  For S=∅ define Gder[∅] = 0 (not used in partitions product except
    #     that if a partition block is empty that does not occur).
    #   - Next, for each subset S of {0..k-1}, compute a list of partitions.  For each partition π of S, we
    #     multiply Gder[block] over all blocks in π, then multiply by ??? Actually that is for e^{L ln F}.
    #     But for Q we sum L^{#blocks} times that product.  Store in a polynomial in L of degree #blocks.  So
    #     we only need the sum over partitions of S of ∏ Gder[block], grouped by #blocks.  That yields a_p(S).
    #   - Then sum a_p(S) over S to get c_p.  Then final = sum_{p=0..k} c_p * sum_{L=1..N} L^p M^L  (mod 998244353).
    #
    # Time is not enough to show each step of the r=4..6 expansions in detail, but we can do it carefully in code.
    #
    # For implementation size/time reasons, here is what we will do:
    #   We only actually need up to FD[S] where |S| <= 6.  We'll store them in a dictionary FD_sums[S].
    #   Then we define a small helper function logFDeriv(S) that uses a known dictionary of expansions
    #   for r=1..6, using FD[S'] for S' ⊆ S.  For instance, for r=3:
    #
    #       let i,j,k = sorted(S)
    #       val = ( FD[{i,j,k}]*M^2
    #               - 3*( FD[{i,j}]*FD[{k}] + FD[{i,k}]*FD[{j}] + FD[{j,k}]*FD[{i}] )*M
    #               + 2*FD[{i}]*FD[{j}]*FD[{k}] ) / M^3
    #
    #   etc. for r=4..6.  We just have to list out those known expansions.  This is a standard result; the
    #   coefficients are the same as the single variable expansions but with symmetrical sums. 
    #
    # Let F1(i)=FD[{i}], F2(i,j)=FD[{i,j}], F3(i,j,k)=..., F4, F5, F6 likewise.  We also define M=FVal=FD[∅].
    #
    # Then we can carefully write them out.  That is a bit large, but straightforward.  We only do it for
    # distinct i < j < ...
    #
    # Let's go!

        #

        #
        #------------------------------------------------------------------
        # ALTERNATIVE that we can do quickly and reliably:
        #
        # We do a little partial-derivative "chain rule engine" that takes ln(F), and does partial_i, partial_j, etc.
        # in sequence, each time evaluating at t=0, but crucially we do not re-apply i if it's used.  This small engine
        # is actually short.  Let's do that for *all* sets S.  This avoids writing out expansions by hand.  It is safer.
        #
        # Implementation:
        #   derivative_of(expr) wrt t_i = ...
        #   but expr = ln(F(t)) or subsequent partial.  We'll do the product rule carefully.  We only do each i once.
        # This is straightforward: each derivative wrt a new variable i hits either ln(F) or the partial expression,
        # always at t=0.  We'll store F(0)=M, partial_i(F)(0)=F1(i), partial_{i,j}(F)(0)=..., but we do need
        # partial_{i}(ln(F)) wrt j => we need partial_{j}( ln(F) ) as well plus partial_{j}( F'(i)/F )...
        #
        # Actually let's implement a small function that directly does partial_{S}( ln(F) ) by repeated differentiation,
        # but in code.  That is what we should do from the start.  We'll do that below for all S up to size k.  Then we
        # won't need these big expansions.  
        #
        raise NotImplementedError("We will use a small chain-rule engine instead (below).")
    
    # Because implementing r=5 and r=6 expansions by hand is quite large (and error-prone),
    # we will now implement the small chain-rule approach for partial_{S}(ln F) at t=0, for distinct S,
    # which is safer and shorter in code for r up to 6.
    
    #--------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Small chain-rule engine for partial_{S}( ln(F) ), with S = (i1, i2, ..., i_r) distinct, i1<...<i_r.
    #
    # We do it in the order i1, then i2, etc.:
    #
    #    d/d t_{i1} [ ln(F) ] at 0 => L1
    #    then d/d t_{i2} [ L1 ] at 0 => L2
    #    ...
    #    finally we get Lr = partial_{S}( ln(F) ) at t=0.
    #
    # We track an expression E that is a function of t, initially E(t)=ln(F(t)).
    # Then partial_i(E) = partial_i( ln F ) = F'_i / F.  But if E is not ln(F), it might be something else
    # from previous derivatives.  We'll define a small function diff(E, i) that returns dE/d t_i at t=0.
    #
    # We'll represent E internally as (typ, data), where typ can be "lnF" or "Prod" or "Const", etc.
    # Then diff(E, i) sees how E is built.  But E can become sums... Actually we might have to store
    # a symbolic expression.  This is also lengthy.  
    #
    # However, each derivative step is at t=0, and we never re-use the same variable i again.  So there's
    # a known simpler formula: if E = ln(F), partial_i(E)(0) = F1(i)/FVal.  Once we have E1 = partial_i(ln F),
    # that E1(t) is a rational function in F and derivatives, we apply partial_j.  It's still complicated.
    #
    # Because we are short on time, we will do an even simpler direct approach: we compute partial_{S}( e^{ln F} ) = partial_{S}(F).
    # Then partial_{S}(ln F) = partial_{S}( ln(F) ) = partial_{S}(ln(F)) can be obtained from partial_{S} of F by
    # the standard log-derivative recursion.  Actually that just circles us back.  
    #
    #--------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Given the time, let's revert to a truly minimal approach for r <= 4, which covers k <= 4.  But k can be 6...
    #
    # Final practical solution:
    #   We will implement the sets S only up to size 3 or 4 in code by expansions, and if k>4, we must do 5 or 6 as well.
    #   Or we do the quick derivative-ladder approach.  Let's do that now in a small function; it is not too big if we are
    #   careful.  We do "E(t) = ln(F(t))", then to get partial_{(i,j)}(ln F)(0), we do:
    #
    #   d/dt_j [ partial_i( ln F ) ] at 0
    #   = d/dt_j [ (F'_i / F) ] at 0
    #   = [ partial_j(F'_i)*F - F'_i * partial_j(F ) ] / F^2  at 0
    #   = [ F''(i,j)*F - F'(i)*F'(j ) ] / F^2  at 0
    #
    # Good.  For partial_{(i,j,k)}, we do partial_k of that expression, at 0.  Then we again do the product rule.  It's about
    # 10 lines of code for each derivative order.  Up to 6 is a bit big but let's do it carefully with a recursion.  We'll
    # store partial_{(i1,...,ir)}( ln F ) in a memo.  Then partial_{(i1,...,ir+1)}( ln F ) is partial_{( last )} of that,
    # using the quotient rule.  We only differentiate (F'_something / F ) or bigger nested fraction.  It's not trivial but
    # let's do it.
    #
    # Because time is nearly gone, I will implement a direct-derivative recursion approach for sets S of size up to k=6.
    # We'll define a function logFDerivRecursive(S) that does:
    #
    #   if len(S)==0: return 0
    #   if len(S)==1: i => return F1(i)/FVal
    #   else:
    #       # let T = S without last element x
    #       # Then partial_{S}(ln F) = partial_x( partial_{T}( ln F ) )
    #       # Let g = partial_{T}(ln F ).  Then partial_x(g) at 0 = ...
    #       # We store maybe a structure that says g(t) = "some ratio ..."?  We can't do purely symbolic easily.
    #       # But we can do the standard formula: g = A/B. partial_x(g) = [partial_x(A)*B - A*partial_x(B)]/B^2.
    #
    # But then A or B might themselves be ratio expressions.  This leads to Faà di Bruno again.  
    #
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # APOLOGIES: In a real setting, one of two practical routes is chosen:
    #   1) Hard-code the expansions for r=1..6 (the standard known ones for multi-distinct partials).
    #   2) Or do a small series expansion of ln(F(t)) in the ring of polynomials with each t_i at most power 1
    #      (because we never do partial_i twice).  Then the coefficient of t_{i1}... t_{i_r} is exactly partial_{S}(ln F)(0).
    #
    # We'll do route #2 now, which is quite short to implement.  Here it is:
    #
    #   - We define a polynomial ring in t_1,...,t_k where each t_i^2=0 (i.e. we treat them as Grassmann variables,
    #     except they commute).  So the only possible monomials are subsets of {1..k}.  We can store the coefficient
    #     of each subset as a dictionary.  
    #   - Then ln(F(t)) is computed by first computing F(t) in that ring, then taking the "poly_ln" in that ring,
    #     ignoring any squares t_i^2 or higher.  
    #   - The coefficient of the subset S in ln(F(t)) is partial_{S}(ln F)(0).  
    #
    # Let us implement that.  This is quite direct: each e^{ x t_i} = 1 + x t_i because (t_i)^2=0.  
    # Then F(t) = sum_{a=1..M} product_{i=1..k}( 1 + e_{p_i}(a)*t_i ).  This is a polynomial with at most 2^k terms,
    # each a distinct subset of {1..k}.  Then we do poly_ln of F(t), using a series expansion of ln(1+X) if F(0)=M>0.
    #
    # Steps:
    #   (1) Build the polynomial P(t) = F(t) - M.  Actually F(t) = M + [some linear and higher terms].
    #   (2) Then ln(F(t)) = ln(M) + ln(1 + P(t)/M).  
    #   (3) Expand ln(1 + Q(t)) = Q(t) - Q(t)^2/2 + Q(t)^3/3 - ... .  But because Q(t) is in a ring where (t_i)^2=0,
    #       any product Q(t)^n with n>=2 will vanish unless it involves distinct t_i's.  We only keep up to
    #       degree k in distinct variables.  But that is straightforward with (t_i)^2=0.  
    #   (4) The coefficient of subset S in that expansion is partial_{S}(ln F)(0).  
    #
    # This is quite easy to code for k <= 6.  We'll proceed now.
    #
    # Implementation details:
    #   - Represent polynomials as a dict: poly[ subset_of_indices ] = coefficient (mod?).  We'll do normal int for now,
    #     then reduce mod at the end or along the way.  
    #   - Multiply polynomials: The product of (I, c1) with (J, c2) is (I ∪ J, c1*c2) if I ∩ J=∅, else 0 if they do overlap
    #     because that would yield t_i^2 for some i.  
    #   - Add polynomials: just add coefficients for the same subset.  
    #   - Then ln(1 + Q) expansion = Q - Q^2/2 + Q^3/3 - ... up to the point that Q^n might vanish if it repeats variables.
    #     We just do a naive approach: define R=0, cur=Q, sign=+1, i=1.. up to k, R += sign * cur / i, cur = cur * Q, sign*=-1.
    #     Because in the worst case k=6, so we do at most 6 terms.  
    #
    # Let's implement.  Then ln(F(t)) = ln(M) + poly_ln(1 + P(t)/M).  The constant "ln(M)" has no effect on partial derivatives
    # with respect to t_i at t=0, so the coefficient of any nonempty subset S in ln(F(t)) is the same as in poly_ln(1 + P(t)/M).
    # That means partial_{∅}(ln F)(0) = ln(M), but we only need it if we want the coefficient of ∅.  Actually we do not
    # add that to Gder[S] for S nonempty.  
    #
    # Let's do it.  That route is the simplest final code.

    #
    #   Let f_p(N) = sum_{L=0..N} L^p x^L.  Then x d/dx of x^L = L x^L.  There's also a known approach with “blocks”:
    #   sum_{L=0..N} L^p x^L = x d/dx of sum_{L=0..N} L^{p-1} x^L, etc.
    # Because p <= 6 is small, we can do it systematically by repeated calls of a function sum_xpow(N, x) = sum_{L=0..N} x^L,
    # then sum_lxpow_1(N, x) = x d/dx of sum_xpow, etc.  Then we combine with fast exponent for x^(N+1).
