        We want the smallest positive integer T such that starting from 'word' (length n),
        and applying T times the operation:
           1) Remove the first k characters.
           2) Append any k characters of our choosing.
        we return to 'word' again.

        Key idea:
          • Each step discards the first k letters but we are free to choose any k letters
            to append at the end.
          • To get back to the original word after T steps, the final string must match
            'word' exactly.
          • Because we can pick any k letters each time, we will always choose them so as
            to maximize how much of the newly formed string matches the beginning of 'word'.
            In particular, each time we form the new string, we want its suffix to overlap
            as much as possible with the prefix of 'word'.

        Algorithm (constructive / simulation approach):
          1) Let n = len(word).  
          2) We define a helper function overlap(suffix, word) that returns the largest r
             such that the last r characters of 'suffix' match the first r characters
             of 'word'.
          3) We define a function next_state(current), which simulates one step of the
             operation in an optimal way (i.e., choosing the k letters so as to produce
             the largest overlap with the start of 'word'):
               • Remove the first k of 'current' => leftover = current[k:].
               • Find how large a prefix of 'word' overlaps with leftover's suffix.
                 Let that overlap be 'a'.
               • We then choose the appended substring = word[a : a + k], ensuring
                 we continue matching as far as possible. 
               • The new string = leftover + appended.
          4) We then try T = 1, 2, 3, ... up to some reasonable bound (for n ≤ 50, going
             up to 2n or so is plenty; in fact, going up to n is often enough in practice,
             but we will be safe and go a bit higher).
               - Start s = word
               - Apply T times next_state(...)
               - If the result equals word (and T>0), return T.
          5) This works for all the provided examples and stays efficient for n ≤ 50.

        Correctness intuition:
          - Because we can append any k letters, there is no penalty in always choosing them
            so as to maximize how much the resulting string lines up with the beginning
            of 'word'. If we can make it become the original 'word' in T steps, this greedy
            strategy will discover such a sequence of appended substrings. We then pick
            the smallest T that succeeds.

        Complexity:
          - We try T up to about 2n (which is at most 100 when n=50).
          - Each step we compute overlap(...) in O(n^2) worst case.
          - That yields at most on the order of 100 * 100 * n^2 = 100 * 100 * 50^2 = 25 million
            operations in the worst scenario, which is borderline but still feasible in Python
            with efficient implementation.  For practical inputs it runs quickly.
