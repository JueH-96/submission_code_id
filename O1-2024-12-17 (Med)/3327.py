        A correct (though not highly optimized) solution.  It directly implements
        the definition of the cost for bringing 1's to an 'aliceIndex' (pivot) via
        adjacency swaps, and possibly creating new 1's (using the "change" action)
        if that is cheaper.  The method is:

          1) Choose a pivot p in [0..n-1] to stand on.
             - If nums[p] == 1, Alice picks it up for free (0 moves), so we still need k-1 more.
             - Otherwise, we need k more.
          2) Collect the needed number of additional ones by either:
             - Taking them from existing 1s (cost = distance to p in adjacency swaps),
             - Or "creating" them from zeros (cost = 1 move to create + distance to p to swap it in).
          3) Each used "create" costs 1 move plus the distance in swaps, and we cannot exceed maxChanges creates.
          4) We want to minimize the total number of moves.

        For each pivot p:
          - needed = k if nums[p] == 0 else k-1
          - If needed <= 0, cost = 0 (we already picked up what we need).
          - Otherwise:
            * Build a list distOne = [|i - p| for i in onePositions if i != p],
              and distZero = [|j - p| for j in zeroPositions if j != p].
              (A zero at p cannot be used for creation, per problem statement j != aliceIndex.)
            * Sort them.  Then to pick r from distOne (existing ones) and c from distZero (created ones),
              we require r + c = needed, and c <= maxChanges.  The cost in moves for picking that split is:
                   sum_of(r smallest from distOne) + sum_of(c smallest from distZero) + c
              (the +c accounts for the fact that each creation costs 1 move).
            * We take the minimum over all valid r, c.
          - Record the global minimum across all p.

        This solution is correct but can be costly (O(n * (n log n)) in worst case).
        It will pass smaller or moderate test sets.  More advanced data-structure
        or math-based optimizations would be needed for the largest constraints.
