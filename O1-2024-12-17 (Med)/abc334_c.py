    # A known result for minimizing âˆ‘|i - j| when pairing is to sort
    # and then form pairs of "adjacent" socks in the sorted order.
    #
    # - If L is even, we simply pair them consecutively: (S[0],S[1]), (S[2],S[3])...
    #   The cost is sum( S[2i+1] - S[2i] ) for i = 0..(L/2 -1).
    #
    # - If L is odd, exactly one sock must remain unpaired ("skipped").
    #   We want to choose which sock to skip so that the cost of pairing the rest
    #   is minimized, again in consecutive order once that sock is removed.
    #
    # An efficient way to do this (in O(L)) after sorting is:
    #   pre[i]  = minimal cost to pair up to (but not including) index i
    #             (0-based) with no skips, possibly leaving 1 leftover if i is odd.
    #   post[i] = minimal cost to pair from index i to the end,
    #             possibly leaving 1 leftover if (end - i) is odd.
    #
    # Then if we decide to skip S[i], the total cost is pre[i] + post[i+1].
    #
    # We'll compute:
    #   - pre array of length L+1 (where pre[i] considers S[:i])
    #   - post array of length L+1 (where post[i] considers S[i:])
    #
    # Finally:
    #   if L even: answer = pre[L]
    #   if L odd : answer = min_{0 <= i < L}( pre[i] + post[i+1] )
