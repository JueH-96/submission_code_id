        We want to pick k disjoint subarrays to maximize the given 'strength':
            strength = sum[1]*k - sum[2]*(k-1) + sum[3]*(k-2) - ...
        which can be expressed as:
            strength = Î£_{i=1..k} [ ((-1)^(i+1)) * (k - i + 1) * (sum of i-th chosen subarray) ].

        The order of subarrays is left-to-right in the array (i.e. we cannot reorder them arbitrarily),
        so the i-th chosen subarray in left-to-right order is multiplied by a fixed factor
        factor[i] = ((-1)^(i+1)) * (k - i + 1).

        We use a dynamic programming approach akin to the "maximum sum of k non-overlapping subarrays",
        but each chosen subarray sum is weighted by factor[i], which may be positive or negative.
        
        Let prefixSum[i] = sum of nums[:i], with prefixSum[0] = 0.
        Define bestDP[i][j] = the maximum achievable strength using j subarrays within the first i elements.
        Also define dp[i][j] as the strength if the j-th subarray ends exactly at index i.

        Then:
            dp[i][j] = factor[j] * prefixSum[i] + max_{0 <= x < i} [ bestDP[x][j-1] - factor[j]*prefixSum[x] ]
        
        We iterate i from 1..n, and keep track of:
            M = max_{0 <= x < i} [ bestDP[x][j-1] - factor[j]*prefixSum[x] ]
        so that we can compute dp[i][j] in O(1).

        Finally, bestDP[i][j] = max(bestDP[i-1][j], dp[i][j]) so we can skip using index i or use it.

        We return bestDP[n][k] in the end.
        Since n*k <= 10^6, this O(n*k) solution is feasible.
