        """
        We have an even-length string s.  For each query [a,b,c,d], we can
         • rearrange s[a..b]   (which lies entirely in the left half of s)
         • rearrange s[c..d]   (which lies entirely in the right half of s)
        and we want to know if, by those rearrangements alone, we can make the entire string a palindrome.

        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        OVERVIEW OF THE SOLUTION

        1)  "Pairing" and "Mismatches":
            Because s has even length n, the palindrome condition means:
               for each i in [0..(n/2)-1],
                  s[i] must match s[n-1-i].
            We call each such (i, n-1-i) a "pair".
            If s[i] != s[n-1-i], that pair is a mismatch.

        2)  Which mismatches can be "fixed" under a query?
            A mismatch at pair i can be corrected only if at least one side
            of the mismatch is in the rearrangeable zone:
               • the left side is i ∈ [a,b], or
               • the right side is (n-1-i) ∈ [c,d].
            If neither side of a mismatch is in the query’s rearrangeable zones,
            that mismatch cannot be changed → the query must fail.

            Thus, the first quick check per query is "coverage": 
            Every mismatch i must lie in [a,b] or else its mirror (n-1-i) in [c,d].
            Equivalently,
               i in [a,b]  OR  i in [n-1-d, n-1-c]
            (since (n-1-i) in [c,d] ⇔ i in [n-1-d, n-1-c]).
            If there is a mismatch outside these two intervals, the answer is False.

        3)  Character requirements / frequency matching:
            Even if a mismatch is "covered," we also must ensure that the needed
            characters exist in the rearrangeable zones in sufficient quantity.
            
            Break mismatches into three types with respect to the query:
                • Left-only coverage: i ∈ [a,b], but (n-1-i) ∉ [c,d].
                      → The right side's character is "fixed," so we must have enough
                        of that fixed character in the left-zone pool to match it.
                • Right-only coverage: (n-1-i) ∈ [c,d], but i ∉ [a,b].
                      → The left side's character is "fixed," so the right-zone pool
                        must have enough of that fixed character.
                • Both-sides coverage: i ∈ [a,b] and (n-1-i) ∈ [c,d].
                      → We can pick any matching character c from the left-zone pool
                        and the same c from the right-zone pool, so long as
                        sum_of min(freqLeft[c], freqRight[c]) is large enough
                        to fix all the both-covered mismatches.

            Hence the checking steps for each query become:
               (a) Verify all mismatches are covered (otherwise False).
               (b) Compute freqLeft = frequency of letters in s[a..b].
                   Compute freqRight = frequency of letters in s[c..d].
               (c) Count how many mismatches are left-only, right-only, or both.
                   Let mismatch i have (Lchar, Rchar) = (s[i], s[n-1-i]).
                   
                   - For left-only i, we need freqLeft[Rchar] to be enough.
                   - For right-only i, we need freqRight[Lchar] to be enough.
                   - For both-coverage pairs, all that matters is that the total number
                     of those both-coverage mismatches ≤ ∑ₐ min(freqLeft[a], freqRight[a])
                     once we subtract off the characters already used by left-only or
                     right-only fixes.
               
            If all these requirements can be met, answer is True; else False.

        4)  Efficient data structures:
            - We can precompute all mismatch pairs i where s[i] != s[n-1-i].
              Let mismatchCount = total number of such i.
              We also store for each mismatch i the pair of letters (s[i], s[n-1-i]).
            
            - To quickly check coverage, we only need to count how many mismatches
              lie outside the union [a,b] ∪ [n-1-d, n-1-c].  If any do, answer False.
              Implementing this can be done with a Fenwick Tree (or Segment Tree)
              over the mismatch indices.  Then for a query, we do up to three
              range-count queries to see how many mismatches lie in the complement
              of that union.  If > 0, answer = False.  Otherwise proceed.

            - To do the frequency checks, we use prefix sums of character counts:
                  freqPS[ch][i+1] = number of times letter ch appears in s[:i+1].
              Then freq(s[L..R]) = freqPS[ch][R+1] - freqPS[ch][L].
              This is O(1) per letter once we have built freqPS.

            - Finally, for counting how many mismatches are left-only, right-only,
              both-coverage, and how many of each letter they require, we can store
              for each mismatch i an integer code T = 26*(s[i]-'a') + (s[n-1-i]-'a').
              Then we keep the mismatch indices i in an array pos[T].  For a query,
              we can do three range-counts in pos[T] to find how many are in [a,b],
              [n-1-d, n-1-c], and their intersection.  From these counts we derive
              how many are left-only, right-only, both, grouped by (Lchar, Rchar).
              
              Because there can be up to 676 possible (Lchar,Rchar) pairs,
              one can do up to three binary searches per pair T.  In the worst case,
              this is 676 * 3 * (log(n/2)) per query, which can be large in Python.
              (In a lower-level language this can often be done if implemented carefully.)

            In practice, for very large n and queries, a full implementation with
            676 separate data structures or a wavelet/segment tree might be needed
            for time to pass.  Below is a more direct "textbook" approach, which
            shows the correct logic clearly.  Optimizations (in C++ or similar)
            would be needed to run under very tight time limits.
