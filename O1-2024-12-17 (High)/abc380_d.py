    # For each position K, we observe that the final (infinitely expanded) string
    # can be viewed as blocks of length n (the length of S):
    #
    #   Block 0: S (no invert)
    #   Block 1: invert(S)
    #   Block 2: invert(S)
    #   Block 3: S
    #   Block 4: invert(S)
    #   Block 5: S
    #   ...
    #
    # In fact, whether a given block j is inverted or not depends on the parity
    # of the number of set bits of j (the "popcount").  If popcount(j) is even,
    # that block is just S; if odd, it is invert(S).
    #
    # To find the K-th character (1-based index):
    #   1) Identify which block it belongs to: block_index = (K-1) // n
    #   2) Within that block, the offset = (K-1) % n
    #   3) character = S[offset]
    #   4) If popcount(block_index) is odd, invert the characterâ€™s case
    #
    # This works because after so many (10^100) expansions, the string is huge,
    # and K <= 10^18 is well within that length.  We only need the parity check of
    # block_index for flipping case.
