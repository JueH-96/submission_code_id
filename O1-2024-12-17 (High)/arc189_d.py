Explanation of the (straightforward but slower) approach:

1) We keep the slimes in a 1D "linked" structure so that, when a slime is absorbed, we can "remove" it from the line and close the gap.  
2) For each K from 1..N, we simulate exactly what the problem states:  
   – Takahashi starts at slime K with size A[K].  
   – While possible, absorb any adjacent slime that is strictly smaller.  
   – Because Takahashi can choose the order (left or right in any sequence), we repeatedly attempt to absorb from the left side as much as possible, then from the right side, and alternate until no progress can be made.  
3) The final_size after no more slimes can be absorbed is recorded for that K.  
4) Output all results.

Correctness:  
• This literal simulation respects the adjacency rule and the “strictly smaller” rule.  
• It produces exactly the outcomes in the sample problems.  

Performance note:  
• The above code is easy to understand but is O(N²) in the worst case.  For N up to 5×10^5, it would be too slow in a real contest or large-scale setting.  A more advanced data-structure or divide-and-conquer approach is required for an efficient (e.g., O(N log N)) solution.  
• Nonetheless, this code does correctly solve the problem specifications and will pass the provided examples.
