    # ------------------------------------------------------------
    # 1) We will solve this using a state-based BFS for each instruction.
    #
    #    State representation on the ring:
    #
    #    - We label the ring parts 0..(N-1) internally (0-based) rather
    #      than 1..N. Part i and i+1 (mod N) are adjacent.
    #
    #    - We track the positions of (L, R).  They must always differ.
    #
    #    However, storing dp[i][L][R] is too large (Q*N*N ~ 9e9).
    #    Instead, note that after instruction i, exactly one hand
    #    is at T_i, and the "other" hand could be at any of the other
    #    N-1 positions.  We only need to store dp[i][pos_of_other_hand].
    #
    #    Then to transition from dp[i-1][pos'] to dp[i][pos], we do:
    #       - Figure out what (L_{i-1}, R_{i-1}) was.
    #       - BFS in the (L,R) graph from that one state to every state
    #         that satisfies the i-th instruction (namely L = T_i if H_i='L',
    #         or R = T_i if H_i='R').  Among those "final" states, we record
    #         the position of the other hand and update dp[i][that_position].
    #
    #    But we have multiple "start" states (up to N of them) from dp[i-1].
    #    We do a multi-source BFS: we enqueue all (L_{i-1},R_{i-1}) states
    #    found from dp[i-1] with the appropriate initial cost.  Then we
    #    spread out in the no-collision ring graph.  Whenever we reach a
    #    state that satisfies the i-th instruction, we update dp[i].
    #
    # 2) Encoding states for BFS:
    #
    #    Because L != R, we can represent a state by (L, d) where
    #        d = (R - L) mod N,  d in [1..N-1].
    #    So R = (L + d) mod N.
    #    The number of such pairs is N*(N-1).
    #
    # 3) Adjacency:
    #    From (L, d), let R = (L+d)%N.
    #    Moves (cost = 1 each):
    #       - Move L forward by 1 if L+1 != R  => that requires d != 1
    #         new L' = (L+1) mod N
    #         new d' = (R - L') mod N = ( (L+d) - (L+1) ) mod N = d - 1
    #       - Move L backward by 1 if L-1 != R => that requires d != N-1
    #         new L' = (L-1) mod N
    #         new d' = (R - L') mod N = ( (L+d) - (L-1) ) mod N = d + 1
    #         (all mod N, but d in [1..N-1], so d+1 means (d+1) in [2..N], must not be 0 => d != N-1)
    #       - Move R forward by 1 if (R+1)!=L => that requires d != N-1
    #         R' = (R+1) mod N => new d' = R' - L (mod N) = ( (L+d)+1 - L ) mod N = d+1
    #       - Move R backward by 1 if (R-1)!=L => that requires d != 1
    #         R' = (R-1) mod N => new d' = (R'-L) mod N = ( (L+d)-1 - L ) mod N = d-1
    #
    # 4) BFS approach per instruction:
    #
    #    - We have dp[i-1][pos'] (the minimal cost to end instruction i-1
    #      with the hand H_{i-1} at T_{i-1} and the "other" at pos').
    #    - We decode that into exactly one (L,R) = (T_{i-1}, pos') or (pos', T_{i-1}),
    #      depending on H_{i-1}.  Then we encode it as (L, d) or (pos', d).
    #    - We do a multi-source BFS: dist[start_state] = dp[i-1][pos'].
    #      Put all start_states in a queue with their initial dist.
    #
    #    - Then for each popped state (L,d), cost=dist[L,d].
    #        if H_i='L' and L == T_i => we've satisfied instruction i
    #            => otherHand = R = (L+d)%N
    #            => dp[i][otherHand] = min of dp[i][otherHand], cost
    #        if H_i='R' and R == T_i => we've satisfied instruction i
    #            => otherHand = L
    #            => dp[i][otherHand] = min of dp[i][otherHand], cost
    #      Then expand neighbors with cost+1 if not visited.
    #
    #    - We can stop BFS early if we've found all possible "otherHand"
    #      positions (N-1 of them) for that instruction.  (We do not need
    #      "otherHand" = T_i, because L!=R always.)
    #
    # 5) Finally, the answer is min(dp[Q][pos]) over all pos in [0..N-1].
    #
    # 6) Complexity considerations:
    #    - Each BFS can visit up to N*(N-1) ~ 9e6 states for N=3000.
    #    - Q can be up to 3000, so worst-case ~2.7e10 operations, which is
    #      very large for Python.  In practice, an optimized C++ solution might
    #      handle it if carefully done and if the test data isnâ€™t maxed out.
    #
    #    We will implement the described solution (it is the cleanest correct
    #    method).  In slower Python environments on worst-case data it might be
    #    too slow, but this is the standard approach.

                #
                # But to decode the state from dp[i-1], we actually need usedHand[i-2].
                # At i=1, that index is -1 => there's no real instruction i-0 => the base case.
                #
                # To handle this cleanly, we store "which hand was used to get dp[i]" is usedHand[i-1].
