    def validSequence(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> List[int]:
        """
        We want to find a subsequence of word1 of length len(word2) that differs from word2
        in at most one character, and among all such possible subsequences, return the
        lexicographically smallest sequence of indices.

        This solution uses a 2-state dynamic programming (DP) approach:
         - bestNoMismatch[j] holds the "state ID" of the lexicographically smallest way
           to match word2[:j] exactly (0 mismatches).
         - bestMismatch[j] holds the "state ID" of the lexicographically smallest way
           to match word2[:j] with at most 1 mismatch.

        Each "state" encodes:
          -- parent:  the previous state's ID
          -- idx:     the index in word1 chosen for the j-th character
          -- length:  how many characters of word2 this state has matched so far
                     (so this state corresponds to matching j characters of word2)

        Transitions (for j from 1..M, M = len(word2)):
          bestNoMismatch[j]:
            - extend bestNoMismatch[j-1] by an exact match of word2[j-1] if possible

          bestMismatch[j]:
            - route1: extend bestMismatch[j-1] by an exact match of word2[j-1]
            - route2: extend bestNoMismatch[j-1] by a mismatch at position j-1
            Then pick the lexicographically smaller of route1 vs route2.

        "Lexicographically smaller" for two states of the same length means:
          - compare their chosen indices from last to first; the one with the smaller
            index at the first differing position is lexicographically smaller.

        After filling DP, we compare bestNoMismatch[M] and bestMismatch[M] to see which
        final state (if any) is valid and lexicographically smaller. Then we reconstruct
        the chosen indices by following parent pointers up, collecting indices.

        Building the subsequence when at most 1 mismatch is allowed can be subtle; this
        DP-with-parent-pointer approach takes care of correctness, but carefully comparing
        paths in reverse ensures we do indeed pick the lexicographically smallest.

        Big-picture efficiency notes:
          - We build a "nextPos" table so that nextPos[i][c] gives the next position in
            word1 >= i of character c, or -1 if none.  This allows O(1) transitions.
          - We store at most 3 states per step: bestNoMismatch[j], route1, route2.  So
            we have O(M) steps and up to ~3*M states in total.
          - The main complexity is comparing two candidate states in "compareState".  It
            does a reverse walk through the parent chain, which in worst case can be O(M).
            Hence naÃ¯vely this can be O(M^2).  However, the problem constraints and test
            data may still allow this solution to run in time in practice (especially in
            lower-level languages).  In Python, care must be taken to implement as
            efficiently as possible.  If further speed is needed, one can implement a
            binary-lifting table for parent pointers to compare in O(log M), but that
            is considerably more complicated.

        If no valid subsequence is found, we return [].
