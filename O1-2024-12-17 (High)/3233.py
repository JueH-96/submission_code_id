        We want to find the maximum number of partitions after:
         1) Changing at most one character in s to any (possibly new) lowercase letter,
         2) Then repeatedly taking the LONGEST prefix with at most k distinct letters,
            removing it, and counting one partition for each removal.
        
        A direct (and correct) way is:
         - Compute how many partitions we get with no change.
         - For each index i and each possible changed letter c != s[i],
           compute how many partitions would result and take the maximum.
        
        However, naively this can be up to 26*n times an O(n) "partition check",
        i.e. 26*n^2. For n up to 10^4, that can be too large in Python.

        In practice, we implement this carefully with:
         - A fast O(n) routine to compute the partition count if exactly one character
           (at index i) is changed to letter c.
         - Pruning/early-stopping if we cannot possibly exceed the best result so far.
         - Only 25 candidates for c at each i.

        This still risks high worst-case cost in Python, but with careful implementation
        and pruning it can often pass in contest-style environments. If there were tighter
        time limits, a more sophisticated approach or a lower-level language might be needed.

        The key partitioning routine (largest prefix with â‰¤ k distinct) is straightforward:
          freq array counts frequencies of letters in the current chunk;
          once distinct-count exceeds k, we end a partition and reset.

        We'll do:
          1) Compute the "no-change" count.
          2) Try each position i, and each candidate letter c != s[i], compute the partition
             count. Keep track of the global maximum.
          3) Return that maximum.
