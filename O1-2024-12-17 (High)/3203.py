        """
        We have an even-length string s. For each query (a,b,c,d), we can:
          • rearrange characters in s[a..b] (which lies entirely in the first half of s),
          • rearrange characters in s[c..d] (which lies entirely in the second half of s),
        and we want to check if it's possible to make the entire string a palindrome.

        Key idea:
         1) A string of length n (even) can be viewed as n/2 character-pairs (i, n-1-i).
         2) If a pair is "fully fixed" (neither index is in the allowed rearrange-subranges), 
            those characters must already match. If there's a mismatch there, it's impossible.
         3) If exactly one index of the pair is rearrange-able, we must have the needed matching character
            within that subrange.
         4) If both indices are in the rearrange-able subranges, we can freely pair characters from those
            two multisets (they must match up in counts).

        To implement queries efficiently (up to 10^5), we do the following preprocessing:

         A) Build a mismatch array M of length n/2, where M[i] = 1 if s[i] != s[n-1-i], else 0.
            Then build a prefix sum mismatchPrefix so we can quickly count how many mismatches
            lie in any interval of these first-half indices.

         B) Split s into two halves of length n/2:
              firstHalf[i] = s[i]       for i in [0..(n/2)-1]
              secondHalf[i] = s[n/2 + i] for i in [0..(n/2)-1]
            Also define an array T where T[i] = s[n-1-i], i in [0..(n/2)-1].
            (This T[i] is precisely the "mirrored" character of s[i] in the second half.)

         C) Build prefix frequency arrays (size = (n/2+1) × 26) for:
              freqFH for firstHalf
              freqSH for secondHalf
              freqT  for T
            so we can get the frequency distribution of a substring/segment in O(26) time.

         D) For each query (a,b,c,d):
             -- Let half = n//2.
             -- The second-half substring is c..d, but in zero-based inside secondHalf,
                that becomes c' = c - half, d' = d - half.
             -- We define fixableRange2 in the first-half index domain [0..half-1] as
                fixableRange2 = [ (n-1-d) .. (n-1-c) ],  i.e. all i for which (n-1-i) in [c..d].
            
             1) Check "fully fixed" mismatches:
                - The union of intervals [a..b] and fixableRange2 is where we CAN fix pairs.
                - Any mismatch outside that union makes the answer False.
            
             2) Let freqA = frequency of firstHalf[a..b].
                Let freqB = frequency of secondHalf[c'..d'].
            
             3) Handle half-free pairs:
                - If i in [a..b] but not in fixableRange2, the second-half index is fixed,
                  so we must remove T[i] (= s[n-1-i]) from freqA.
                - If i in fixableRange2 but not in [a..b], the first-half index is fixed,
                  so we must remove firstHalf[i] from freqB.
                If we ever need to remove more characters than available, it's impossible.
            
             4) Fully free pairs:
                - i in [a..b] ∩ fixableRange2 means we can pair up one character from freqA
                  and one (matching) character from freqB. The total number of such pairs is
                  the intersection length. After the half-free removals, let sumA = sum(freqA),
                  sumB = sum(freqB). We need sumA == sumB == intersection_length, and freqA[c] == freqB[c]
                  for every character c. If that holds, we can match them 1-to-1 and succeed;
                  otherwise, fail.

            Return True/False accordingly for each query.

        Complexity:
         - Preprocessing: O(n) to build mismatch array + O(n*26) to build prefix frequencies.
         - Each query in O(1 + 26 + small_constant) ~ O(26) = O(1) for all practical purposes.
         This allows up to 10^5 queries to run feasibly under typical time limits.
