        Slidingâ€“window approach.
        Keep a window [left, right] such that every character appears
        at most twice.  Extend `right` one step at a time; if adding the
        new character breaks the rule, shrink the window from the left
        until the rule is satisfied again.  Track the largest window
        seen.
