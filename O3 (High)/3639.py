        For every position j we can decrement it at most once for every query
        that covers j.  Let cover[j] be the number of queries whose interval
        contains j.  The element nums[j] must not exceed cover[j]; if it does
        we can never perform enough decrements, otherwise we can simply apply
        exactly nums[j] of those cover[j] opportunities and skip the rest.

        So the task reduces to computing cover[j] for all indices and checking
        nums[j] â‰¤ cover[j].  We can obtain cover[] in O(n + q) with the usual
        range-addition / prefix-sum trick.
