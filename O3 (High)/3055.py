        The maximum odd binary number is obtained by:
        1. Placing exactly one '1' as the least-significant bit (to keep the number odd).

        3. Filling the remaining positions in the middle with '0's.
        
        If the input contains k ones and z zeros (k â‰¥ 1), the layout becomes:
