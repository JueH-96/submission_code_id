        For every character in str1 we may either keep it as it is, or increase it
        once (cyclically, so 'z' -> 'a').  After this single mass-operation we want
        str2 to be a subsequence of the new str1.

        During matching each position of str1 therefore supplies a set of *two*
        possible characters:  {c, next(c)}.  We only need to decide whether str2
        can be matched as a subsequence against these sets â€“ a standard two-pointer
        greedy scan suffices.
