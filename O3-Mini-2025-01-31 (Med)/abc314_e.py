    #
    # When playing a wheel i, the outcomes are:
    #    With probability (# outcomes that are 0)/P, the next state remains x.
    #    For each outcome s > 0:
    #         if x+s >= M then we succeed (cost 0 extra) because dp[M]=0,
    #         otherwise we must pay dp[x+s] extra.
    #
    # If we denote for wheel i:
    #    cost = C_i, P = number of outcomes.
    #    Let zeros = count of outcomes with S == 0.
    #    Let add = sum( dp[x+s] for outcomes with s>0 and x+s < M ) 
    #          (and if x+s >= M, dp is 0 so we add nothing).
    #
    # Then the expected extra cost from state x if we use wheel i is initially computed as:
    #    E = C_i + (zeros/P)*dp[x] + (1/P)*[sum_{s>0, x+s<M} dp[x+s]]
    #
    # But notice that the unknown dp[x] appears on the right side if zeros > 0.
    # Rearranging,
    #    dp[x] - (zeros/P)*dp[x] = C_i + (1/P)*[sum_{s>0, x+s<M} dp[x+s]]

    #
    # Because every outcome with s>0 gives x+s > x (since s>=1), we can compute dp[x]
    # by proceeding backwards from x = M-1 down to 0.
