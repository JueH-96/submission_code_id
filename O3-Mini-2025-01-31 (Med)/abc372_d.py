    # For a fixed building i (the observer), when scanning from i+1 to the right,
    # the buildings that are visible are exactly those that form a chain of recordâ€“breakers.

    # that is taller than our current one, each such building is visible.

    # For an index i, dp[i] equals 1 (counting building i itself) plus the chain
    # from next_greater[i] if it exists. Formally:
    #    dp[i] = 1                  if next_greater[i] == -1,
    #    dp[i] = 1 + dp[next_greater[i]]   otherwise.

    #  is the chain starting at position i+1.)
