        # Explanation:
        # We need to find the maximum integer num such that the sum of prices
        # for all integers from 1 to num does not exceed k.
        # The "price" for a given number is defined by its 1-indexed binary representation,
        # counting only those positions i (starting at the right, with i=1 for the LSB)
        # that are multiples of x and where the bit is set.
        #
        # Notice that for each bit position i (where i % x == 0) in a number,
        # the count of numbers in [1, n] having that bit set can be computed without iterating through each number.
        #
        # For a given position i, where the bit value is 2^(i-1) and the period = 2^i,
        # the number of set bits among the numbers 1 to n is:
        #    floor(n / (2^i)) * 2^(i-1) + max(0, (n % 2^i) - 2^(i-1) + 1)
        #
        # Letâ€™s denote pos = j * x (i.e. positions that are multiples of x).
        # Then the overall function f(n) which sums the "prices" for numbers from 1 to n is:
        #    f(n) = sum_{j>=1 such that 2^(j*x - 1) <= n} 
        #             [  (n // (2^(j*x)))*2^(j*x-1) + max(0, (n % (2^(j*x))) - 2^(j*x-1) + 1 ) ]
        #
        # Since f(n) is non-decreasing, we can use binary search to find the maximum num 
        # (i.e., maximum n) such that f(n) <= k.
        #
        # Given constraints (k up to 1e15), an upper bound of 10^18 is safe.
