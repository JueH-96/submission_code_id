Explanation:

1. We first compute a prefix‐sum array so that the sum of any contiguous block can be obtained in O(1) time.

2. For each subarray count j (from 1 to k) the coefficient c = coeff[j] is determined by 
   c = (k - j + 1) if j is odd and c = -(k - j + 1) if j is even.

3. Our dp recurrence is:
   • dp[j][i] = max( dp[j][i-1],  c * prefix[i] + max_{t from j-1 to i-1} [dp[j-1][t] - c * prefix[t]] )
   which ensures the chosen subarray (from some t to i-1) is nonempty.

4. We iterate i from j to n (since we need at least j elements to form j nonempty subarrays)
   and update an auxiliary variable “best” to efficiently compute the inner maximum.

5. Finally, dp[k][n] is returned as the answer.

This program meets the specification and passes the sample tests.
