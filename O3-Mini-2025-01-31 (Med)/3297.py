        # At each operation we remove the first k characters
        # and append k arbitrary characters. This means that after t operations,
        # the first n - t*k characters of the current word are forced:
        # they come directly from the original word (shifted t * k positions).
        # In other words, after t seconds when t*k < n, the word becomes:
        #   forced_part = word[t*k:]   (of length n - t*k)
        #   free_part   = (t*k positions, chosen arbitrarily)
        #
        # To have the final word equal to the initial word, we must have:
        #    forced_part == word[:n - t*k]
        # because we may choose the free part arbitrarily to fill
        # the remainder.
        #
        # Also, if t*k >= n then the entire word becomes free
        # (because removed forced part is of length â‰¤ 0)
        # and we can simply choose all characters to match word.
        # Therefore, one valid answer is always t = ceil(n/k) (if no earlier t works).
        
        # Let t vary over operations that leave a forced part (i.e. t*k < n)
        max_t = math.ceil(n / k)

            # forced part length = n - t*k (this is positive by loop constraint)
            forced = word[t*k:]
            prefix = word[:n - t*k]
