        # Explanation:
        # We want to remove some edges so that:
        #  1. Every node has a path to node 0.
        #  2. Each node has at most "threshold" outgoing edges.
        #  3. The maximum edge weight among those remaining is minimized.
        #
        # A spanning arborescence (a directed spanning tree where every node except 0
        # has exactly one incoming edge) ensures condition (1). In the chosen arborescence,
        # a nodeâ€™s outgoing edges are just its children in the tree. Thus if we can pick,
        # for every node v (except 0), one incoming edge such that the parent (say u)
        # does not provide more than threshold edges (i.e. u is parent to at most threshold nodes),
        # then both connectivity and the outdegree constraint are met.
        #
        # Notice that the chosen edges must have weight <= X for some candidate X and
        # we want to minimize X. So we can binary search on X (taken from the unique weights).
        #
        # For a given X we consider only those edges with weight <= X.
        # Then, for every vertex v (v != 0) we try to assign a parent u (making use
        # of an edge u->v) so that no node u is used more than threshold times.
        #
        # This is exactly a bipartite matching problem where:
        #   - Right side: nodes {1,2,...,n-1} (each requiring one incoming edge).
        #   - Left side: all nodes 0..n-1; each u can supply up to "threshold" edges.
        #   - There's an edge from u (left) to v (right) if there is an edge u->v in the
        #     original graph (with weight <= X).
        #
        # We can check if there is a matching covering every node on the right.
        # To do that we use a DFS-based matching algorithm that handles capacity >1 on left nodes.
        
        # Get sorted unique weights.
