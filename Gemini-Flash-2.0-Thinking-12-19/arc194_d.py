# The provided solution implements the prime decomposition and permutation counting logic.
# This approach assumes that any permutation of the prime factors of the original string is reachable.
# This assumption is derived from the sample explanation and the common structure of such problems on parenthesis sequences.
# The specific reversal operation defined in the problem description might be the mechanism
# that enables these permutations, particularly the swapping of adjacent prime factors,
# although a direct proof that the character-wise operation on A B always results in B A
# seems to require A and B to be fixed points under the operation.
# However, if the sample output is correct, the overall effect must be equivalent to prime factor permutation.
