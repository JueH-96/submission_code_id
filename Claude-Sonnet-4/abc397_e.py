Wait, this approach might be too slow and complex. Let me think of a better approach.

Actually, let me think about this more systematically. For a tree to be decomposable into N paths of length K each:

1. We need exactly N*K vertices (which we have)
2. We need to be able to partition these vertices into N groups of K consecutive vertices each
3. This is possible if and only if we can greedily construct such paths

A key insight: in any tree decomposition into paths, the endpoints of paths must be leaves or vertices of degree â‰¥ 3. Vertices of degree 2 must be internal to some path.

Let me implement a greedy approach:
