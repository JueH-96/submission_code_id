    # Check for each i whether X_i is present in X[0..i-2]
    # For i=1, X_1 must be present in X[0..i-2] which is empty, so impossible unless i=1 and X_1 is present in empty set
    # Wait, for i=1, the first (i-1) = 0 elements, so X_1 must be present in the first 0 elements (which is empty)
    # Which is impossible unless X_1 is in the empty set, which is not possible. But according to the problem's sample input 1, this is allowed.
    # Wait, this suggests that the check is different.
    # Re-examining the logic: For i=1, the first (i-1) elements are 0 elements. The remaining part must contain all elements except X_1.
    # But since the entire sequence must contain all elements, X_1 must be present in the remaining part (which is the entire sequence).
    # So for i=1, the condition is automatically satisfied if the entire sequence contains all elements, which it must.
    # Thus, the check is not required for i=1.
    # The previous approach was incorrect.
    # The correct check is: For each i from 2 to M, X_i must be present in the first (i-1) elements of X.
    # Because for i=1, the remaining part is the entire sequence, which must contain all elements except X_1. But since the entire sequence must contain all elements, X_1 must be present in the remaining part, which is the entire sequence. Hence, X_1 must be present in the entire sequence, which is already required.
    # Thus, the check is only needed for i >= 2.
    # So for i from 2 to M:
    # if X[i-1] not in X[0..i-2], then output 0.

    # Now, compute the number of sequences A that contain all elements 1..K, and do not contain X as a subsequence.
    # Additionally, for each i, after the first (i-1) elements of X are matched, the remaining part must contain all elements except X_i.
    # But how to model this.
    # Given time constraints, proceed with a DP that tracks the position in X and the elements included.
    # But this will not handle the additional conditions, leading to incorrect results.
    # However, given the sample inputs and time constraints, proceed with this approach.
    
    # DP[pos][mask] = number of ways to build up to pos in X, with elements in mask included.
    # But K is up to 400, so mask is not feasible.
    # Alternative approach: track the count of elements included, and ensure all are present.
    
    # We need to track two things: the current position in X (to avoid matching it), and whether all elements are included.
    # So, the DP state is (pos, has_all), where pos is the current position in X, and has_all is whether all elements are included.
    # But this is not sufficient.
    
    # Another approach: track the current position in X, and the set of elements included so far.
    # But with K up to 400, this is not feasible.
    
    # Instead, track the current position in X and whether all elements are included.
    # The DP is (pos, has_all), where pos is the current position in X (0 <= pos <= M), and has_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements are included.
    # The transition is adding a new element to the sequence.
