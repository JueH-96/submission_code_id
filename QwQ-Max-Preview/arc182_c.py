    # Wait, but this is the same as the incorrect approach earlier. However, given the sample input 1, this approach works.

    # Let's test this approach for sample input 1:
    # M=7, primes are 2,3,5,7
    # For p=2: sum (e_p(m)+1) for m=1-7 is 1+2+1+3+1+2+1=11
    # For p=3: 1+1+2+1+1+2+1=9
    # For p=5: 1+1+1+1+2+1+1=8
    # For p=7: 1+1+1+1+1+1+2=8
    # Product is 11*9*8*8 = 6336, but sample output is 16. So this approach is incorrect.

    # Thus, this approach is invalid. Need to find another way.

    # Alternative Idea: The correct approach is to model the multiplicative contribution of each element, considering that each element's contribution to the product of divisors is multiplicative.

    # Let's consider that each element m contributes a multiplicative factor of (sum_{d | m} d(X)), but this is unclear.

    # Given time constraints, the correct approach involves multiplicative convolution and inclusion-exclusion, but I'm unable to derive it here.

    # The correct approach is to model the sum as the product over primes of (sum_{k=1 to N} (sum_{m=1 to M} (e_p(m) + 1))^k) modulo MOD.

    # However, this is incorrect as shown in sample input 1.

    # Another Idea: The correct approach is to model the sum as the product over primes of (sum_{s=0}^{max_e} (s+1) * (number of ways to have sum exponents s for p in sequences of length up to N))).

    # For each prime p, the number of ways to have sum exponents s is computed using dynamic programming with matrix exponentiation.

    # This seems plausible. Let's proceed.

    # For each prime p, compute the possible exponents contribution.
    # For each prime p, the maximum exponent per element is the maximum exponent of p in 1..M.
    # For example, for p=2 and M=16, the maximum exponent is 4 (from 16=2^4).

    # For each prime p, the possible exponents added per element are 0, e_p(m) for m in 1..M.

    # The state for dynamic programming for prime p is the current sum of exponents modulo something, but since exponents can be large, we need a way to model transitions.

    # Instead, for each prime p, the contribution can be modeled using generating functions.

    # The generating function for sequences of length k for prime p is (f_p)^k, where f_p is the sum over m of x^{e_p(m)}.

    # The sum over all sequences of (s_p +1) is the sum over k=1 to N of the sum of coefficients of x^s in (f_p)^k multiplied by (s+1).

    # This is equivalent to evaluating the generating function at x=1 and x=1 again, but this is not straightforward.

    # Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following code based on multiplicative functions and matrix exponentiation.

    # The correct approach is to model each prime's contribution using a dynamic programming state that tracks the sum of (s_p +1) for sequences up to length N.

    # For each prime p, the transition is a linear recurrence, which can be modeled using matrix exponentiation.

    # For each prime p, the contribution is the sum over sequences of (s_p +1), which can be computed using matrix exponentiation.

    # The total answer is the product of these contributions for all primes.

    # Let's implement this.

    # For each prime p, compute the possible exponents and their contributions.

        # The sum of contributions for p is sum_m (e_p(m) + 1)
        # However, the transitions are additive. For each step, adding an element m contributes e_p(m) to the current sum s_p.
        # The state is the current sum s_p, and the value we track is (s_p + 1).
        # When adding an element m, the new sum is s_p + e_p(m), and the new value is (s_p + e_p(m) + 1) = (s_p +1) + e_p(m)
        # So the recurrence is: dp_new[s] = sum_{m} dp_old[s - e_p(m)] * (s - e_p(m) +1 + e_p(m)) ?

        # Alternatively, we can model the state as the current value of (s_p +1), and track how adding an element m changes this value.

        # Let's model the transitions for each prime p.

        # The initial state is no elements: s_p = 0, value is 1 (since 0 +1 =1)
        # For each step (adding an element), the new value is sum_{m} (current_value + e_p(m)) ?

        # For example, for a sequence of length k, the sum of (s_p +1) is the sum over all sequences of length k of (sum e_p(m_i) +1)

        # The recurrence for this sum is:
        # dp[k] = sum_{m} (dp[k-1] + sum_e_p(m) * count_prev)
        # But this is unclear.

        # Let's think of it as follows:
        # For each step, when adding an element m, the new sum (s_p +1) is (previous s_p + e_p(m) +1) = (previous s_p +1) + e_p(m)
        # So the total sum for sequences of length k is sum_{m1,..,mk} product_{i=1 to k} (sum_{j=1 to i} e_p(mj) +1) ?

        # This seems complex. However, there's a way to model this using a linear recurrence.

        # Let's denote that for each step, the contribution is a linear function of the previous sum.

        # Letâ€™s define for each prime p:

        # = sum_{m=1 to M} [ dp[k-1] + e_p(m) * M^{k-1} ]

        # Now, the recurrence is dp[k] = M * dp[k-1] + sum_e_p * M^{k-1}

        # The homogeneous recurrence relation is:
        # dp[k] = M * dp[k-1] + sum_e_p * M^{k-1}

        # Let's solve this recurrence.

        # The homogeneous solution is dp_h[k] = C * M^k

        # For the particular solution, assume dp_p[k] = A * M^k * k

        # A M^k k = M (A M^{k-1} (k-1)) ) + sum_e_p M^{k-1}
        # A M^k k = A M^k (k-1) + sum_e_p M^{k-1}
        # Multiply both sides by M:
        # A M^{k+1} k = A M^{k+1} (k-1) + sum_e_p M^k
        # Rearranging:
        # A M^{k+1} (k - (k-1)) ) = sum_e_p M^k

        # A M = sum_e_p
