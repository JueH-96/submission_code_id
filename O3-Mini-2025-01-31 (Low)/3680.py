        # We interpret the graph as follows:
        # Two nodes (with values a and b) are connected by an edge if lcm(a, b) <= threshold.
        # Note that lcm(a, b) = a * b // gcd(a, b).
        #
        # A key observation is that if either a or b is greater than threshold,
        # then lcm(a,b) >= max(a,b) > threshold. So such nodes CANNOT connect with any other node.
        #
        # Therefore, we can separate the nodes into:
        #   - "Small" nodes: those with value <= threshold.
        #   - "Large" nodes: those with value > threshold.
        # Large nodes are isolated.
        #
        # Next, for the small nodes we need to determine connectivity.
        # Notice that for two small numbers, a,b <= threshold, the condition lcm(a,b) <= threshold
        # is equivalent to: a * b // gcd(a,b) <= threshold.
        # Checking every pair among small nodes is too slow.
        #
        # Instead, we use the following idea:
        # For any common number L (1 <= L <= threshold), if two different small numbers both
        # divide L then L is a common multiple of the two numbers. In particular, since the minimal
        # common multiple is lcm(a,b), we have lcm(a,b) <= L <= threshold.
        # So if for some L, at least two small numbers divide L then these numbers must be connected.
        #
        # We then use a sieveâ€“like method.
        #
        # Steps:
        # 1. Partition the numbers: S (small numbers <= threshold) and isolated (large numbers > threshold).
        # 2. Build a mapping from value to its index in an array "arr" representing S.
        # 3. For each small number d, iterate over its multiples m (from d to threshold, step d)
        #    and for m, record that d (its corresponding index) divides m.
        # 4. For each m from 1 to threshold, if more than one small number divides m,
        #    union them in DSU.
        # 5. The connected components among small numbers are given by DSU,
        #    and each large number is an isolated component.
        
        # Separate small and large nodes.
