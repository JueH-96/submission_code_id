    # A valid pair (s,t) (with s != t) is counted in one of two cases:
    #
    # 1. When the clockwise walk from s to t involves no wrap-around (s < t).
    #    The number of steps is P[t-1] - P[s-1] (taking proper mod M arithmetic)
    #    and since we want that to be a multiple of M, we require:
    #           (P[t-1] - P[s-1]) mod M == 0  <=> P[t-1] == P[s-1].
    #    Thus, for indices i<j (in our P array) with the same remainder, the pair is valid.
    #
    # 2. When the walk from s to t involves a wrap-around (s > t).
    #    In that case the number of steps is: total - (P[s-1] - P[t-1]).
    #    We need: (total - (P[s-1] - P[t-1])) mod M == 0.

    #           P[s-1] == P[t-1] + total (mod M).
