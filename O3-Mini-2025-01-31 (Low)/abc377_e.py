                # Actually, careful: we need result[i] = the element after applying operation K times.
                # But note that operation: P[i] becomes P(P_i). Our transformation: newMapping(i) = P^2(i).
                # Let's recalc.
    
    # Wait, reconsider: The operation "for i=1,2,...,N update P_i to P[P_i]" is effectively: new permutation = P composed with P, i.e. squaring.
    # But as described, if we apply operation once, the new permutation Q is Q(i) = P(P(i)).
    # Then after K operations, it means Q = P^(2^K)? But wait, let's re-read the problem:
    # "For i=1,2,...,N, simultaneously update P_i to P_{P_i}" -> That means updating the list using the current permutation.
    # Initially, P = (P_1, ..., P_N). After one operation, 
    # index 1 gets value P_{P_1} but note that positions maintain index ordering.
    # Let A be the array index: then new A[i] = A[A[i]].
    # But if we consider positions from 1 to N, then initial P defines mapping i -> P[i]. And after the update:
    # new P[i] becomes old P[ old P[i] ] = (P composed with itself)(i).
    # So the operation effectively does: P = P âˆ˜ P.
    # If we denote f(i)=P[i], then after first op, f becomes f^2, after 2 op, f becomes f^4, after K op f becomes f^(2^K).
    # However, the provided example does not match f^(2^K) since sample: P=(5,6,3,1,2,4). Then f(1)=5, f(2)=6, f(3)=3, f(4)=1, f(5)=2, f(6)=4.
    # f^2(1)=f(5)=2. f^(2^3)=f^(8)(1) should be computed over cycle length? Let's check cycles.
    # Cycle analysis:{
    #   1->5->2->6->4->1 forms cycle length 5, and 3 is fixed.
    # }
    # Operation says after 3 operations: new P[1] = 6.
    # On cycle (1,5,2,6,4): f^(2^3)(1) = f^8(1)=? 8 mod 5=3, so in cycle: cycle[ index (0+3) mod5] = ? cycle = [1,5,2,6,4]; 1->5->2->6, should yield 6; that matches.
    # So indeed after K operations, mapping is f^(2^K). 
    # So how we combine cycles: For each cycle of length L, the new mapping for element x is: move forward by (2^K mod L) places.
    # So we need to compute shift = 2^K mod L.
    # Modify code accordingly.
