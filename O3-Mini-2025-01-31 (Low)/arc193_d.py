        # the pivot. Hence, moving a piece from position a to b requires exactly |a - b| operations.
        # We would like to cover each target square (in B with value '1')
        # with at least one piece from A.
        # Since the operations move pieces simultaneously and extra pieces can be merged into
        # target squares without extra penalty, the minimum number of moves needed is
        # at least the maximum shift needed for some matching between a subset of pieces in A and all indices in B.
