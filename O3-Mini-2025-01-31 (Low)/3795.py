        # For index j, we need to decide which queries (among the ones whose range covers j) will be applied
        # to subtract exactly nums[j] in total.
        # Since each query decision is independent per index, the existence of a valid choice is equivalent
        # to the subset sum feasibility: Is there a subset (of query contributions v) among those queries that affect index j
        # that sums exactly to nums[j].
        # We'll process queries in order and use a bitset dynamic programming approach.
        # dp[j] will be an integer bitmask representing achievable sums for element j.
        #
        # We initialize for each j: only sum 0 is achievable.

        # Note: Because our dp uses a bitmask, and as nums[j] can be up to 1000 and each query decrement up to 10,
        # the maximum achievable sum might be a bit large. However, since queries length is at most 1000,
        # and bit shifting integers in Python can be done quite efficiently, this approach is acceptable.
