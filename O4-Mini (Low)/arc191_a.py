    # by a two‚Äêpointer greedy that tries to improve S from left to right
    # while respecting the order of T and allowing us to "waste" small T's on
    # the rightmost end when they can't help.
    #
    # Concretely, we keep a deque for the future operations.  Whenever we're
    # at position i in S, we look ahead in T (at our current pointer) for the
    # largest digit we *can* still use at or after that pointer that would
    # strictly exceed S[i].  If we find one, we assign it.  Otherwise we keep
    # S[i] as is.  Any T's we skip in pursuit of a better digit for S[i] we
    # must "waste" somewhere; the optimal place to waste them is always at
    # position N (the least significant place), because that does least harm.
    #
    # This runs in O(N + M) time by maintaining for each digit 1..9 a queue
    # of its positions in T, and a Fenwick tree (BIT) to count how many T's
    # we've skipped before a given index.
