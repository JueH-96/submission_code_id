    # We simulate choices by greedily keeping as large a sum as possible
    # while respecting that we only have (N - i) future operations at step i
    # to "pop" elements we've pushed.  If at step i our current stack size
    # exceeds the number of remaining steps, we are forced to issue pops
    # (each pop consumes one of the remaining steps).  When forced, we should
    # pop the smallest element in our stack (to lose as little sum as possible).
    #
    # Implementation:
    #   - We keep a minâ€‘heap `h` of all values we've chosen to push so far.
    #   - We keep running sum `s` of those values.
    #   - At step i (0-based), we "push" A[i]:  add it to h and to s.
    #   - Then we check: our current number of pushes = len(h).
    #     The number of remaining indices (hence remaining ops) is (N - (i+1)).
    #     If len(h) > remaining_ops, we must pop exactly
    #       len(h) - remaining_ops
    #     times right now (we can actually do them lazily one by one).
    #   - Each forced pop we take the smallest from h and subtract it from s.
    #
    # At the end, s is the maximum achievable sum.
    #
    # Complexity: O(N log N).
