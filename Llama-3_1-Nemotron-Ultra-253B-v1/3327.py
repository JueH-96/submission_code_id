<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the problem is about Alice picking up k ones from a binary array with some operations, and we need to find the minimum number of moves required. Hmm.

First, let's understand the problem step by step. The initial step is that Alice picks an index (aliceIndex) and picks up the one there if it exists. Then, she can perform moves. Each move is either:

1. Change a 0 to 1 (but this can be done at most maxChanges times). But wait, the first action is selecting a j not equal to aliceIndex where nums[j] is 0 and set to 1. So, this is adding a 1, but not at the current aliceIndex. And each such action counts as a move. Also, each such action can be done up to maxChanges times.

Or,

2. Swap adjacent indices x and y where x and y are adjacent, nums[x] is 1 and nums[y] is 0. So, this is moving a 1 from x to y. But if y is the aliceIndex, then after swapping, Alice picks up that one (so the nums[y] becomes 0 again). So, each such swap is a move.

The goal is to collect exactly k ones with the minimum number of moves.

Hmm. So, the challenge is to model how these operations can be used optimally to gather k ones, starting from some initial position.

Let's think about the example given. In example 1, the output is 3. Let's see why. Alice starts at index 1, picks up the 1 there. Then she uses a change to set index 2 to 1. Then swaps 2 and 1 (so the 1 moves to index 1, which is her position, so she picks it up. Then another swap from 0 to 1, which she picks up. So total 3 moves.

So, each time a swap brings a 1 to her position, she can collect it. Also, the changes can create new 1s that can be moved towards her.

So, the key seems to be that Alice can collect 1s either by:

- Having them moved to her position via swaps (each swap moves a 1 one step closer, possibly, and when it reaches her, she picks it up, which requires a swap step).

Or, she can create new 1s (using the change action) and then move them towards her via swaps.

But creating a 1 via change might be useful if the cost (1 move for the change plus the swaps needed to bring it to her) is better than other options.

Wait, but the change action creates a 1 at some j != aliceIndex. Then, to get that 1 to Alice's position, you need to swap it step by step. Each swap moves the 1 one step closer, and each such swap is a move. So, for example, if the change is done at a position that's d steps away from aliceIndex, then it would take d swaps to bring it to her. But each swap is a move. So the total cost for that 1 is 1 (for the change) + d (swaps). But when the 1 reaches her position via a swap, she picks it up, so that's one more 1 collected, and the position is 0 again.

Alternatively, maybe some 1s are already present in the array, and Alice can collect them by moving them towards her via swaps. For existing 1s, the cost would be the number of swaps needed to bring them to her position.

So, the problem reduces to selecting a set of 1s (either existing or created via changes) such that the total cost (swaps + change operations) is minimized, and the total number of 1s collected is exactly k.

But how do we model this?

First, let's consider the initial position. Alice can choose any aliceIndex to start with. So, we need to find the best possible starting position that minimizes the total moves.

But trying all possible starting positions would be O(n), which for n up to 1e5 is manageable if each position's processing is O(1) or O(k) time. But k can be up to 1e5 as well, so O(nk) would be 1e10, which is way too slow.

So, we need a smarter approach.

Let's think about the optimal starting position. For example, if there's a cluster of 1s, maybe starting in the middle of that cluster would minimize the total distance for collecting them. But when we have to create new 1s, the optimal position might be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal starting position is such that the sum of the distances (for the required 1s) is minimized. But how do we model that?

Alternatively, maybe the problem can be transformed into a sliding window problem, where we need to select a window of 1s (existing and created) that can be collected with minimal moves.

Wait, let's think about the existing 1s. For each existing 1, the cost to collect it is the distance from the starting position, because each step requires a swap. For example, if a 1 is at position i, and the starting position is a, then the number of swaps needed is |i - a|. But wait, when you swap, the 1 moves one step each time. So, if the 1 is to the left of a, you need (a - i) swaps to bring it to a. Each swap moves the 1 right by one. Then, when it reaches a, Alice picks it up, so that's one move (the swap) and the 1 is collected.

But for existing 1s, the cost is the distance from a. For created 1s, the cost is 1 (for the change) plus the distance from a (the swaps to bring it to a).

So, the problem becomes selecting a starting position a, and then selecting some existing 1s and some created 1s (up to maxChanges) such that the total number is k, and the sum of (distance for existing 1s) + (1 + distance for created 1s) is minimized.

But how to model this?

Hmm. Let's consider that for each possible starting position a, we can compute the minimal cost to collect k 1s, considering that we can take up to maxChanges created 1s.

But even that seems computationally heavy. So, perhaps we can find a way to model this with a sliding window approach, where for each possible a, we can find the optimal set of 1s (existing and created) around a.

Alternatively, maybe the optimal a is such that the collected 1s (existing and created) are in a contiguous block around a. But I'm not sure.

Let's think about the example 1. The starting position is 1. The existing 1s are at 0,1,5,6,9. But after the initial pick, the 1 at 1 is taken. Then, they create a 1 at 2 (cost 1 move), then swap it to 1 (cost 1 move). Then, swap 0 to 1 (cost 1 move). So, total 3 moves. So, the created 1s are at 2, and then existing 0 and 1 (but after initial pick, 1 is 0). So, perhaps the optimal approach is to collect the existing 1s that are close to a, and create 1s that are even closer.

Another approach: For each position a, the initial 1 (if present) is collected for free. Then, for the remaining k-1 (if the initial was 1) or k (if initial was 0) 1s, we need to collect them via moves.

Wait, the initial step is that Alice picks up the 1 at a, if it's there. So, if nums[a] is 1, then she collects it immediately, and that's not counted as a move. So, the initial collection is free. Then, the rest of the k-1 1s need to be collected via moves. But if the initial a has 0, then she doesn't collect anything initially, and needs to collect all k via moves.

So, the first thing is to decide whether to start at a position where nums[a] is 1. Because that gives a free 1. So, for example, if k is 3, and the initial a is 1 (which is 1), then we need to collect 2 more 1s via moves. But if the initial a is 0 (which is 0), then we need to collect all 3 via moves.

So, the optimal starting position is likely to be a position where nums[a] is 1, as that gives a free 1. But if there are not enough 1s in the array (i.e., sum(nums) + maxChanges >=k, but sum(nums) might be less than k), then we might have to create some 1s.

So, perhaps the first step is to compute the initial 1s. Let's denote s = sum(nums). Then, the number of 1s we can get from the initial collection is 1 if we start at a 1, and 0 otherwise. So, if s >=k, then maybe starting at a 1 is better. But if s <k, then we need to create (k - s) 1s, but we can create up to maxChanges. But the problem states that sum(nums) + maxChanges >=k, so it's possible.

But how to model all this.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to collect as many existing 1s as possible, and then use the changes to create the remaining ones. But the order in which we collect them (existing vs created) depends on their cost.

So, for each possible starting position a, we can compute:

- The number of existing 1s that can be collected (excluding the initial one if a is a 1) with their cost (distance from a), and the number of created 1s (with cost 1 + distance from a). Then, select a combination of existing and created 1s such that the total is k (minus the initial 1 if applicable) and the sum of costs is minimized.

But how to do this efficiently.

Let me think of the problem as follows:

Suppose we start at position a. Let's first check if nums[a] is 1. If so, we collect it for free, and need to collect k-1 more. Otherwise, we need to collect k.

For the remaining required 1s, each can be either an existing 1 (not at a, since after initial collection, a is 0) or a created 1 (which can be placed anywhere except a, but then moved to a via swaps).

So, for each existing 1 (other than a), the cost to collect it is the distance from a (since each swap moves it one step, and each swap is a move). For created 1s, the cost is 1 (for the change) + distance from a (swaps to bring it to a).

So, the problem becomes, for each a, select a subset of existing 1s (not including a) and created 1s (up to maxChanges) such that the total number is req = (k - initial_collected) and the sum of costs is minimized.

But how to compute this for all a efficiently.

Alternatively, for each a, the optimal way to collect the required 1s is to take the closest existing 1s (since their cost is lower) and then use created 1s for the remaining, but considering that created 1s have a higher cost (1 + distance) compared to existing 1s (distance). So, for a given a, the existing 1s are better than created ones if their distance is less than (1 + distance) of some created positions.

Wait, but created 1s can be placed anywhere except a. So, for a created 1, the minimal cost would be 1 (for the change) + 0 (if we place it adjacent to a, but wait, the created 1 can be placed at j != a. So, the minimal cost for a created 1 is 1 (change) + 0 (if j is adjacent to a, but then you need to swap once to bring it to a. Wait, no. Let's think:

If you create a 1 at j, which is adjacent to a (distance 1). Then, the cost is 1 (change) + 1 (swap to move it to a). So total 2. But if you create it at a position that's two steps away, then cost is 1 + 2 =3. So, the minimal cost for created 1s is 1 (change) + 0 (if j is a itself, but j can't be a. So the minimal possible cost for a created 1 is 1 (change) + 0 (if j is adjacent, but wait, j can't be a. So the closest possible is adjacent. So, for a created 1, the minimal cost is 1 (change) + 1 (swap) = 2. But for existing 1s, the cost is the distance. So, existing 1s at distance 1 would have cost 1, which is better than created 1s (cost 2). So, existing 1s are better than created ones if their distance is less than (1 + distance of created). Wait, but created 1s can be placed anywhere. So, for a created 1, the optimal j is as close as possible to a. So, the minimal cost for a created 1 is 1 (change) + d, where d is the distance from j to a. To minimize this, j should be as close as possible to a. So the minimal possible cost for a created 1 is 1 + 0 (if j is a, but j can't be a. So the next best is j at a-1 or a+1, which gives d=1. So cost 1+1=2.

So, existing 1s at distance d are better than created 1s if d <= 2. Because for d=1, existing cost 1, created cost 2. For d=2, existing cost 2, created cost 1 (change) + 2 (distance) = 3. So existing is better. So, for existing 1s, we should collect them first if their distance is less than (1 + d_j) where d_j is the distance for created 1s.

But this seems complicated. Maybe the optimal approach is to collect the existing 1s that are closest to a, and then use created 1s for the remaining, but the created 1s should be placed as close as possible to a.

So, for each a, the steps would be:

1. Collect the initial 1 (if any) at a. So, initial_collected = 1 if nums[a] is 1, else 0. The required 1s is req = k - initial_collected.

   If req <=0, then the answer is 0 (but since k is at least 1, this can only happen if initial_collected >=k. But since k is given as a positive integer, perhaps this case is when initial_collected is 1 and k=1. So the answer is 0 moves.)

2. For the required req 1s, collect the minimal cost:

   a. Collect as many existing 1s (excluding a) as possible, sorted by their distance to a. Take the closest ones first, up to min(req, available_existing_1s).

   b. The remaining required 1s (if any) will be created. For each created 1, the minimal cost is 1 (change) + distance from a. But since we can choose where to create them, the minimal distance would be 0 (but can't create at a). So the next best is distance 1 (left or right of a). So, each created 1 contributes a cost of 1 + 1 = 2. But wait, if we create it at a distance d from a, then the cost is 1 (change) + d (swaps). So, the minimal possible cost for created 1s is 1 + d, where d is as small as possible.

   So, the optimal way is to create the 1s as close as possible to a. So, for each created 1, the cost is 1 (change) + d (swaps), where d is the distance from a to the created position. To minimize this, we can create the 1s in positions as close as possible to a.

   But since we can create multiple 1s, but each created 1 must be at a different position (since after creating, that position is 1, but when you create another, you can't create at the same position again unless it's set back to 0. But the problem allows us to create a 1 at j !=a as long as nums[j] is 0 at the time of creation. So, after creating a 1 at j, if we swap it to a, then j becomes 0 again. So, perhaps we can create multiple 1s at the same j, but only when it's 0 again.

   But this complicates things. However, the problem allows us to perform the change action any number of times (up to maxChanges) as long as the j is not a and nums[j] is 0 at the time of the change.

   So, perhaps the optimal way to create 1s is to create them at positions adjacent to a, so that each created 1 can be moved to a in 1 swap. So, for each created 1, the cost is 1 (change) + 1 (swap) = 2. But if we have to create multiple 1s, perhaps we can alternate between left and right adjacent positions. For example, create at a-1, swap to a (cost 2), then create at a+1, swap to a (cost 2), etc. So each created 1 costs 2 moves.

   Alternatively, if we create a 1 at a-1, swap to a (cost 2). Then, if we need another created 1, we can create it again at a-1 (since after swapping, a-1 is 0 again). So, each created 1 at a-1 would cost 2 moves. So, for m created 1s, the cost is m * 2.

   So, for created 1s, the minimal cost per 1 is 2 moves. So, for the remaining required 1s after using existing ones, if we can create them, the cost is 2 * m, where m is the number of created 1s. But this is only possible if the maxChanges allows it (m <= maxChanges).

   So, putting this together:

   For a given a, the total cost is:

   - sum of the distances of the closest (req_existing) existing 1s (excluding a) +

   - (req_created) * 2 +

   - (number of created 1s) (since each requires a change action, which is limited by maxChanges).

   Wait, but the created 1s require a change action (cost 1 move per created 1) and then the swaps (distance) per created 1. So, the total cost for a created 1 is 1 (change) + d (swaps), where d is the distance from a to the created position. So, if the created position is adjacent to a, then d=1, so cost is 2 per created 1.

   So, for created 1s, the minimal cost per 1 is 2, assuming we can create them adjacent to a.

   So, the strategy for a given a is:

   1. Collect the initial 1 (if any) at a. req = k - initial_collected.

   2. Collect as many existing 1s (excluding a) as possible, sorted by their distance to a. Take the first m_existing = min(req, available_existing_1s). The sum of their distances is sum_d.

   3. The remaining req_remaining = req - m_existing. These must be created 1s. The number of created 1s needed is m_created = req_remaining. The cost for these is m_created * 2 (since each requires 1 change and 1 swap). But also, m_created must be <= maxChanges.

   4. So, the total cost is sum_d + m_created * 2.

   But this is only possible if m_existing + m_created >= req (which they are by definition) and m_created <= maxChanges.

   If m_created > maxChanges, then this a is not a valid starting position.

   So, for each a, we need to compute:

   - initial_collected (0 or 1)

   - req = k - initial_collected. If req <=0, then cost is 0.

   - existing_1s = list of distances of 1s (excluding a) sorted in increasing order.

   - m_existing = min(req, len(existing_1s))

   - sum_d = sum of the first m_existing distances.

   - remaining = req - m_existing

   - if remaining > maxChanges, then this a is not possible.

   - else, total cost is sum_d + remaining * 2.

   So, the minimal cost for a is sum_d + remaining * 2, provided that remaining <= maxChanges.

   So, the approach would be:

   For each possible a (0 <= a < n):

   - compute initial_collected (1 if nums[a] is 1, else 0)

   - req = k - initial_collected

   - if req <=0: cost is 0 (but only if initial_collected >=k. But since k is at least 1, this is possible only when initial_collected is 1 and k=1. So cost is 0.)

   - else:

      - collect all existing 1s (excluding a) and compute their distances to a. Sort them in increasing order.

      - take the first m_existing = min(req, len(existing_1s)) elements. sum_d is sum of these.

      - remaining = req - m_existing

      - if remaining > maxChanges: skip this a.

      - else: total cost is sum_d + remaining * 2.

   The minimal such total cost over all a is the answer.

   But the problem is that for n=1e5, iterating over all a and for each a, collecting the existing 1s and sorting them is O(n^2) time, which is not feasible.

   So, we need a way to compute for each a the sum of the m_existing smallest distances quickly.

   So, the key challenge is to pre-process the existing 1s in a way that for any a, we can quickly find the sum of the m_existing smallest distances from a to the existing 1s (excluding a itself).

   Let's think about the existing 1s. Let's precompute a list of positions where nums[i] is 1. Let's call this list ones.

   Then, for a given a, the existing 1s (excluding a) are the ones in the list ones, except if a is in ones, then we exclude it.

   For each a, the existing 1s (excluding a) are the list ones' elements, except if a is present in ones, then we remove it.

   Then, for each a, the distances to these existing 1s are |x - a| for x in ones (x !=a).

   We need to find the sum of the m_existing smallest distances.

   The problem is, for each a, how to compute this sum efficiently.

   Let's consider that the ones list is sorted. Because the positions are in the array, so they are in order. So, the list ones is sorted in increasing order.

   For a given a, the distances to the existing 1s (excluding a) can be considered as the distances to the elements in ones, except possibly a itself.

   So, for a given a, the existing 1s (excluding a) are the elements in ones, except if a is in ones, then we have to exclude it.

   Let's first find the elements in ones that are not equal to a. Let's call this list valid_ones for a.

   Then, the distances are |x -a| for x in valid_ones.

   We need to find the sum of the first m_existing smallest distances.

   The key observation is that the sum of the m_existing smallest distances can be computed using a sliding window approach if the valid_ones are sorted. Since the valid_ones are sorted (because ones is sorted), the distances to a will form a V-shaped sequence. So, the minimal distances are around the position where x is closest to a.

   For example, if a is in the middle of the ones list, the distances to the left and right will form a V-shape. So, the minimal distances are the ones closest to a.

   So, for the valid_ones list, which is sorted, the distances to a are |x -a|. To find the sum of the first m_existing smallest distances, we can find the window of size m_existing around the position where x is closest to a, and compute the sum.

   So, the approach for a given a is:

   1. Find the valid_ones (existing 1s excluding a).

   2. Compute the distances of each valid_ones to a.

   3. Find the m_existing smallest distances and sum them.

   The problem is how to do this efficiently.

   Since the valid_ones list is sorted, the distances are |x -a|. So, the minimal distances are the ones closest to a. So, the minimal m_existing distances are the ones in the valid_ones that are closest to a.

   So, for the sorted valid_ones list, we can find the insertion point of a, and then the minimal distances are the ones around that insertion point.

   For example, if the valid_ones are [x1, x2, ..., xn], sorted, and a is some value, then the insertion point is the index where a would be inserted to keep the list sorted. The elements around this insertion point are the closest to a.

   So, the minimal m_existing distances would be the m_existing elements in the valid_ones that are closest to a.

   So, for the valid_ones list, we can find the left and right pointers that form a window of m_existing elements around the insertion point, and compute the sum of their distances.

   But how to compute this sum quickly.

   Let's think of the valid_ones list as sorted. Let's precompute prefix sums for the valid_ones.

   For example, for the valid_ones list, we can precompute prefix_sum[i] = sum of the first i elements.

   Then, for a window [l, r], the sum of the elements is prefix_sum[r] - prefix_sum[l].

   But the sum of distances is sum |x -a| for x in the window.

   This sum can be computed as:

   sum (a - x) for x <=a, and sum (x -a) for x >a.

   But how to compute this efficiently for a window.

   Alternatively, for a given window of elements in valid_ones, the sum of |x -a| can be computed as:

   sum (a - x_i) for x_i <=a + sum (x_j -a) for x_j >a.

   Let's denote the number of elements <=a as cnt_left, and their sum as sum_left.

   The sum of a -x_i for x_i <=a is a * cnt_left - sum_left.

   Similarly, the sum of x_j -a for x_j >a is (sum_right) - a * cnt_right, where sum_right is the sum of x_j and cnt_right is the number of elements >a.

   So, for a window of elements, if we can find how many are <=a and their sum, and how many are >a and their sum, we can compute the sum of distances.

   To do this efficiently, we can use binary search to find the split point (the first element >a). Then, for the window, we can compute the left part and right part.

   So, the steps for a given a and valid_ones list:

   1. Find the split point using binary search (the index where elements transition from <=a to >a).

   2. For the window of m_existing elements, which can be split into left and right parts around the split point.

   But how to find the optimal window of m_existing elements that gives the minimal sum of distances.

   This seems like a problem that can be solved with a sliding window approach, but given that the list is sorted, perhaps we can find the optimal window in O(1) or O(log n) time.

   Alternatively, since the valid_ones list is sorted, the sum of distances for a window of m_existing elements can be minimized by selecting the window that is closest to a.

   For example, the window of m_existing elements that includes the elements closest to a.

   So, the optimal window is the one that starts at index i, such that the elements from i to i + m_existing -1 are the closest to a.

   But how to find this i.

   Alternatively, the optimal window is the one where the median of the window is as close as possible to a. But I'm not sure.

   This seems complicated. Let's think of an example.

   Suppose valid_ones = [1,3,5,7,9], a=4, m_existing=3.

   The distances are 3 (1 to 4 is 3), 1 (3 to 4), 1 (5 to 4), 3 (7 to 4), 5 (9 to 4).

   The minimal sum of 3 distances is 1 (3) +1 (5) +3 (7) = 5? Or wait, the three closest are 3,5,7: their distances are 1,1,3. Sum is 5. Or maybe 1,3,5: distances 3,1,1. Sum 5.

   So, the window could be [3,5,7] or [1,3,5], but the sum is the same.

   So, the optimal window is the one that includes the elements closest to a.

   So, for the sorted list, the optimal window is the one that starts at the position where the elements are as close as possible to a.

   So, the approach is:

   For the valid_ones list, find the window of size m_existing that has the minimal sum of |x -a|.

   Since the list is sorted, this can be done using a sliding window approach.

   But for each a, this would take O(n) time, which is not feasible for n=1e5.

   So, we need a way to compute this sum for each a in O(1) or O(log n) time.

   Let's think of the valid_ones list as sorted. For a given a, the sum of the m_existing smallest distances is the sum of the distances of the m_existing elements in valid_ones that are closest to a.

   So, the problem reduces to, given a sorted list, and a target a, find the sum of the m_existing elements closest to a.

   This is a classic problem. Let's see.

   For example, given a sorted array, and a target value a, find the sum of the m elements closest to a.

   How to do this efficiently.

   The approach would be:

   1. Find the insertion position of a in the sorted array. Let's call this pos.

   2. Then, the closest elements are around pos. We need to select the left and right elements such that the total number is m_existing.

   3. For example, the window could be from pos - left to pos + right, where left + right +1 = m_existing.

   But how to find the optimal left and right.

   Alternatively, the optimal window is the one that starts at pos - (m_existing -1) if the elements to the left are closer, or ends at pos + (m_existing -1) if the elements to the right are closer.

   But this is not necessarily the case.

   Alternatively, the optimal window can be found by considering the elements from pos - (m_existing -1) to pos, or pos to pos + (m_existing -1), or some other combination.

   But this seems tricky.

   However, since the array is sorted, the elements to the left of pos are <=a, and elements to the right are >=a.

   So, the closest elements are the ones immediately before and after pos.

   So, the optimal window of size m_existing is the one that starts at pos - left and ends at pos + right, where left + right +1 = m_existing.

   The sum of their distances can be computed as:

   sum_{i=0}^{left} (a - x_{pos - left + i}) + sum_{i=0}^{right} (x_{pos + i} -a)

   To find the minimal sum, we need to choose left and right such that left + right +1 = m_existing, and the sum is minimized.

   But how to find the best left and right.

   For example, if m_existing is even, we might take more elements from the left or right, depending on which gives a smaller sum.

   This seems like a problem that can be solved with prefix sums and binary search.

   Let's precompute the prefix sums of the valid_ones list. Let's call it prefix_sum.

   Then, for a given pos, the sum of elements from l to r is prefix_sum[r+1] - prefix_sum[l].

   So, for the left part (elements <=a), the sum of elements from start to end is prefix_sum[end+1] - prefix_sum[start].

   The sum of distances for these elements is a*(end - start +1) - (prefix_sum[end+1] - prefix_sum[start]).

   For the right part (elements >=a), the sum of distances is (prefix_sum[end+1] - prefix_sum[start]) - a*(end - start +1).

   So, for a given window that includes some left elements and some right elements, the total sum can be computed using these formulas.

   The challenge is to find the window of size m_existing that has the minimal sum.

   Let's think of the following steps:

   1. Find the insertion position pos of a in the valid_ones list.

   2. The number of elements in the left part (<=a) is left_count = pos.

   3. The number of elements in the right part (>=a) is right_count = len(valid_ones) - pos.

   4. We need to select l elements from the left and r elements from the right, such that l + r = m_existing, and l <= left_count, r <= right_count.

   5. The optimal l and r would be such that the sum of distances is minimized.

   For example, if we can take all elements from the left and right that are closest to a, that would give the minimal sum.

   So, the optimal l and r would be:

   l = min(left_count, m_existing)

   r = m_existing - l

   But if r exceeds right_count, then adjust l and r.

   Alternatively, the optimal l is the maximum possible such that l <= left_count and (m_existing - l) <= right_count.

   So, l can range from max(0, m_existing - right_count) to min(left_count, m_existing).

   For each possible l in this range, compute the sum of distances and choose the minimal one.

   But how to compute this efficiently.

   For example, the minimal sum could be when we take as many elements as possible from the left and right closest to a.

   So, the optimal l is the maximum possible l where l <= left_count and (m_existing - l) <= right_count.

   So, l = max(0, m_existing - right_count)

   Wait, no. Let's see:

   We need to select l elements from the left and r = m_existing - l elements from the right.

   The constraints are l <= left_count and r <= right_count.

   So, l can be at most left_count, and r can be at most right_count.

   So, substituting r = m_existing - l:

   m_existing - l <= right_count => l >= m_existing - right_count

   Also, l >=0.

   So, the valid range for l is:

   l >= max(0, m_existing - right_count)

   and

   l <= min(left_count, m_existing)

   So, the possible l values are in this range.

   For each l in this range, we can compute the sum of distances.

   The minimal sum would be the minimal of these.

   But how to compute this quickly.

   For example, the sum for a particular l is:

   sum_left = a * l - (prefix_sum[pos] - prefix_sum[pos - l])

   sum_right = (prefix_sum[pos + r] - prefix_sum[pos]) - a * r

   total_sum = sum_left + sum_right

   where r = m_existing - l.

   So, for each l in the valid range, compute this sum and take the minimal.

   The valid range for l can be from l_min to l_max, where:

   l_min = max(0, m_existing - right_count)

   l_max = min(left_count, m_existing)

   If l_min > l_max, then there's no valid l, but since we have enough elements (m_existing <= len(valid_ones)), this shouldn't happen.

   So, the steps for a given a and valid_ones list are:

   1. Compute pos = bisect.bisect_left(valid_ones, a)

   2. left_count = pos

   3. right_count = len(valid_ones) - pos

   4. l_min = max(0, m_existing - right_count)

   5. l_max = min(left_count, m_existing)

   6. Iterate l from l_min to l_max, compute the sum for each l and select the minimal.

   But iterating l from l_min to l_max could take O(m_existing) time, which for m_existing up to 1e5 is not feasible.

   However, the valid range for l is actually very small. For example, if the valid_ones list is large, the range l_min to l_max could be just a few values.

   Let's see:

   For example, if m_existing is 1000, and right_count is 500, then l_min = 1000 -500 =500. l_max is min(left_count, 1000). If left_count is 1000, then l ranges from 500 to 1000. But this is 501 values, which would take O(1) time if we can compute the sum for each l in O(1) time.

   Wait, but for each l in the range, the sum can be computed in O(1) time using the prefix sums.

   So, the total time for each a is O(1) (since the range of l is up to O(1) values, but in practice, it's O(1) for each a).

   So, for each a, the time to compute the sum of the m_existing smallest distances is O(1) time.

   Therefore, the overall approach is feasible.

   So, putting it all together:

   The steps are:

   1. Precompute the list of ones (sorted).

   2. For each possible a in 0..n-1:

      a. Compute initial_collected = 1 if nums[a] is 1 else 0.

      b. req = k - initial_collected.

      c. If req <=0: cost is 0. Keep track of the minimal cost.

      d. Else:

         i. valid_ones = [x for x in ones if x !=a]

         ii. m_existing = min(req, len(valid_ones))

         iii. remaining = req - m_existing

         iv. if remaining > maxChanges: skip this a.

         v. else:

             - Compute the sum of the m_existing smallest distances in valid_ones to a.

             - total_cost = sum_d + remaining * 2

             - Keep track of the minimal total_cost.

   3. Return the minimal total_cost across all a.

   Now, the problem is to implement this efficiently.

   Let's think about how to compute valid_ones for each a.

   The list ones is the list of all positions where nums[i] is 1. So, for a given a, valid_ones is ones without a, if a is in ones.

   So, for a given a, we can check if a is in ones. Since ones is sorted, we can use binary search to check if a is present.

   But checking for a in ones for each a (n=1e5) would take O(n log m) time, where m is the number of ones.

   But m can be up to n, so O(n log n) time, which is acceptable.

   So, for each a:

   - Check if a is in ones using binary search.

   - If yes, then valid_ones is ones with a removed. But how to do this efficiently.

   But creating a new list for each a is O(m) time, which is not feasible.

   So, we need a way to represent valid_ones for a given a without creating a new list.

   So, for example, for a given a, valid_ones is the list ones, but excluding the element a (if present). So, during the computation for a, when we process the ones list, we can ignore the element a.

   So, when a is in ones, the valid_ones list is ones[0..idx-1] + ones[idx+1..], where idx is the position of a in ones.

   But for the purpose of binary search and prefix sums, we can compute the pos in the original ones list, and then adjust for the exclusion of a.

   Let's think:

   Suppose a is in ones. So, in the original ones list, the element a is at index idx.

   So, the valid_ones list is ones[0..idx-1] + ones[idx+1..].

   So, when processing a, the valid_ones list is the original ones list minus the element a.

   So, when we compute pos in the valid_ones list (the insertion position of a in valid_ones), it would be the same as the insertion position in the original ones list, but adjusted for the exclusion of a.

   But this seems complicated.

   Alternatively, during the processing of a, we can compute the valid_ones list as follows:

   if a is not in ones:

      valid_ones = ones

   else:

      valid_ones = ones but exclude a.

   But how to compute this efficiently.

   Let's precompute the ones list.

   For each a, we can check if a is in ones using binary search. If it is, then the valid_ones list is the ones list with that element removed. But we can't create a new list for each a, as that would be O(n) time per a.

   So, we need to find a way to compute the sum of the m_existing smallest distances in the valid_ones list without explicitly creating the list.

   Let's think of the valid_ones list as the original ones list, but with the element a (if present) removed.

   So, for the purpose of binary search and sum computation, we can treat the valid_ones list as the original ones list, but during the computation, we ignore the element a.

   So, when a is in the ones list, the valid_ones list has len(ones) -1 elements. Otherwise, it's the same as ones.

   So, during the processing of a:

   - Check if a is in ones. Let's call this is_a_in_ones.

   - The length of valid_ones is len(ones) - is_a_in_ones.

   - m_existing = min(req, len(valid_ones)).

   - If m_existing < req, then remaining = req - m_existing. If remaining > maxChanges, skip.

   So, the main challenge is to compute the sum of the m_existing smallest distances in the valid_ones list.

   Let's proceed as follows:

   For a given a, the valid_ones list is ones, but with a removed (if present).

   So, when processing a, we can compute the pos in the original ones list (the insertion position of a in ones), and then adjust for the exclusion of a.

   Let's first compute pos in the original ones list.

   pos = bisect.bisect_left(ones, a)

   Now, if a is in ones, then the valid_ones list is ones[0..pos-1] + ones[pos+1..].

   So, the valid_ones list has the same elements as ones, except for the element at pos.

   So, when computing the sum of distances for the valid_ones list, we need to exclude the element at pos (if a is in ones).

   So, the approach is:

   For the valid_ones list:

   - The elements are the same as ones, except for the element a (if present).

   So, when computing the sum of distances for valid_ones, we can compute the sum for the original ones list, and then subtract the distance for a (if present) if it is included in the window.

   But this seems complicated.

   Alternatively, during the processing of a, the valid_ones list is the original ones list with a removed. So, when a is in ones, the valid_ones list is of length m = len(ones) -1. Otherwise, it's m = len(ones).

   So, for the valid_ones list, the sum of the m_existing smallest distances can be computed as follows:

   Compute the sum for the original ones list, and then subtract the contribution of a (if it was included in the window and is present in the original list).

   But this approach may not be feasible.

   So, perhaps the best way is to precompute the prefix sums for the original ones list, and then for each a, compute the sum for the valid_ones list by considering whether a is present in the original list.

   Let's proceed step by step.

   Let's precompute the prefix sums for the original ones list.

   prefix_sum[i] = sum of the first i elements of ones.

   For a given a:

   1. Check if a is in ones using binary search. Let's call this is_a_in_ones.

   2. Compute the valid_ones_count = len(ones) - is_a_in_ones.

   3. Compute req = k - initial_collected.

   4. m_existing = min(req, valid_ones_count).

   5. remaining = req - m_existing.

   6. If remaining > maxChanges: skip.

   7. Else: compute sum_d.

   To compute sum_d:

   We need to compute the sum of the m_existing smallest distances in the valid_ones list.

   The valid_ones list is the original ones list minus a (if present).

   So, the sum_d is the sum of the m_existing smallest distances in the valid_ones list.

   To compute this, we can compute the sum of the m_existing smallest distances in the original ones list, and then subtract the distance of a (if it was included in the original sum and is present in the original list).

   But how to determine if a was included in the original sum.

   Alternatively, we can compute the sum for the original ones list, and then adjust for the exclusion of a.

   Let's think:

   sum_d_original = sum of the m_existing smallest distances in the original ones list.

   if a is in ones:

      then, the valid_ones list is the original ones list minus a.

      So, if the original sum_d_original includes a's distance, then we need to subtract it and add the next smallest distance.

      But this is complicated.

   So, perhaps it's easier to compute the sum_d for the valid_ones list directly.

   Let's proceed as follows:

   For the valid_ones list:

   if a is not in ones:

      valid_ones = ones

   else:

      valid_ones = ones without a.

   So, for the valid_ones list, we can compute the sum_d as follows:

   - Compute the sum of the m_existing smallest distances in the valid_ones list.

   To compute this, we can use the original ones list and adjust for the exclusion of a.

   Let's first compute the sum_d in the original ones list, assuming that a is not in the list.

   Then, if a is in the list, we need to adjust the sum_d by excluding a's distance and including the next closest distance.

   But this seems complicated.

   Alternatively, for the valid_ones list, we can compute the sum_d by considering the original ones list and the position of a.

   Let's proceed with the following steps:

   1. Compute pos in the original ones list (bisect_left(ones, a)).

   2. If a is in ones:

      - The valid_ones list is ones[0..pos-1] + ones[pos+1..].

      - The valid_ones list has len(ones) -1 elements.

      - So, when computing the sum_d for valid_ones, we need to find the m_existing smallest distances in valid_ones.

      - To do this, we can compute the sum_d for the original ones list, but exclude the element at pos, and adjust the window accordingly.

   But this is not straightforward.

   So, perhaps the best way is to compute the sum_d for the valid_ones list by treating it as the original ones list with a possible element removed.

   But how.

   Let's think of the valid_ones list as the original ones list, but with the element at pos removed (if a is in ones).

   So, for the valid_ones list:

   - The elements are the same as ones, except for the element at pos.

   So, when computing the sum_d for valid_ones, we can compute the sum_d for the original ones list, and then subtract the contribution of the element at pos if it was included in the window.

   But how to determine if the element at pos was included in the window.

   Alternatively, for the valid_ones list, the sum_d can be computed by considering the original ones list and adjusting the window to exclude the element at pos.

   This seems very complex.

   So, perhaps the problem is too difficult to solve with this approach, and we need to find a different way.

   Let's think of another approach.

   The key insight is that the optimal starting position a is one of the positions where there is a 1, or a position where a 1 can be created nearby.

   But this is not necessarily true.

   Alternatively, perhaps the optimal a is among the positions of the existing 1s. Because starting at a 1 gives a free 1, which reduces the required 1s by 1.

   So, perhaps we can limit the possible a's to the existing 1s and some other positions.

   But if the sum of the existing 1s is less than k, then we have to create some 1s, and the optimal a may be a position where created 1s can be easily collected.

   But this is not clear.

   Another idea: For each a, the cost is sum_d (existing 1s) + 2 * remaining (created 1s). The sum_d is the sum of the m_existing smallest distances. So, the sum_d is minimized when a is in a position where the existing 1s are clustered around a.

   So, the optimal a is likely to be in the middle of a cluster of existing 1s.

   So, perhaps we can precompute for each existing 1, the sum_d for a being that 1, and then also consider some other positions (like the midpoints between existing 1s) to find the minimal sum_d.

   But this is not guaranteed.

   Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the initial plan, but find a way to compute the sum_d for the valid_ones list efficiently.

   So, let's proceed to code.

   First, precompute the list of ones.

   Then, for each a in 0..n-1:

   - Check if a is in ones.

   - Compute initial_collected.

   - Compute req.

   - If req <=0: cost is 0.

   - Else:

      - valid_ones_count = len(ones) - (1 if a is in ones else 0)

      - m_existing = min(req, valid_ones_count)

      - remaining = req - m_existing

      - if remaining > maxChanges: skip.

      - else:

          - Compute sum_d for valid_ones list.

          - total_cost = sum_d + 2 * remaining.

   The key is to compute sum_d efficiently.

   So, for the valid_ones list, which is the original ones list minus a (if present), how to compute the sum of the m_existing smallest distances.

   Let's proceed as follows:

   For the valid_ones list:

   if a is not in ones:

      valid_ones = ones

      m = len(ones)

   else:

      valid_ones = ones without a.

      m = len(ones) -1

   So, for the valid_ones list, the sum_d is the sum of the m_existing smallest distances from a.

   To compute this sum_d, we can use the original ones list and adjust for the exclusion of a.

   Let's first compute the sum_d for the original ones list, and then subtract the contribution of a if it was included in the sum.

   So, sum_d_original = sum of the m_existing smallest distances in the original ones list.

   if a is in ones:

      then, in the original sum_d_original, the distance for a (which is 0) is included if m_existing >0.

      But in the valid_ones list, a is excluded, so we need to subtract the distance for a (0) and add the next smallest distance.

      But how to compute this.

   This seems complicated.

   Alternatively, for the valid_ones list, the sum_d is the sum of the m_existing smallest distances in the valid_ones list.

   So, for the valid_ones list, which is the original ones list minus a (if present), the sum_d can be computed by:

   1. Compute the sum of the m_existing smallest distances in the original ones list, excluding a.

   So, the approach is:

   For the original ones list:

   - Compute the sum of the m_existing smallest distances, but exclude a if it is present.

   So, the steps are:

   a. Compute the sum of the m_existing smallest distances in the original ones list.

   b. If a is in the original ones list and m_existing >0:

      i. Check if the distance for a (0) is included in the sum.

      ii. If yes, subtract 0 and add the next smallest distance.

   But how to determine if a's distance is included.

   For example, if a is in the original ones list, then the distance from a to a is 0, which is the smallest possible. So, in the original sum_d_original, the sum includes 0 if m_existing >=1.

   So, in the valid_ones list, this 0 is excluded, so the sum_d for valid_ones is sum_d_original - 0 + (the next smallest distance if m_existing >=1).

   But this next smallest distance is the m_existing-th smallest distance in the original ones list (excluding a).

   This seems complicated.

   So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum_d for the valid_ones list directly, without relying on the original sum_d_original.

   Let's proceed to implement the sum_d computation for the valid_ones list.

   So, for a given a, the valid_ones list is:

   if a is in ones:

      valid_ones = ones[0..pos-1] + ones[pos+1..]

   else:

      valid_ones = ones

   So, the valid_ones list is a sorted list.

   So, for the valid_ones list, we can compute the sum_d as follows:

   1. Find the insertion position of a in valid_ones (using bisect_left).

   2. Compute the left_count = pos (number of elements <=a in valid_ones).

   3. Compute the right_count = len(valid_ones) - pos.

   4. Determine the range of l (number of elements to take from the left).

      l_min = max(0, m_existing - right_count)

      l_max = min(left_count, m_existing)

   5. For each l in l_min to l_max:

      i. r = m_existing - l

      ii. sum_left = a * l - (prefix_sum[pos] - prefix_sum[pos - l]) 

         (if l >0, sum_left is a*l - sum of the l elements from pos - l to pos-1)

      iii. sum_right = (prefix_sum[pos + r] - prefix_sum[pos]) - a * r

      iv. total_sum = sum_left + sum_right

      v. keep the minimal total_sum.

   But the prefix_sum is for the valid_ones list, which is different from the original ones list.

   So, we need to compute the prefix_sum for the valid_ones list.

   But creating a new prefix_sum for each a is not feasible.

   So, we need to compute the prefix_sum for the valid_ones list on the fly.

   But how.

   Let's think:

   For the valid_ones list, which is the original ones list minus a (if present), the prefix_sum can be computed as follows:

   if a is not in ones:

      prefix_sum_valid = prefix_sum_original

   else:

      prefix_sum_valid is the prefix_sum_original, but with the element a removed.

      So, for the valid_ones list, the prefix_sum_valid[i] is:

      for i < pos: prefix_sum_original[i]

      for i >= pos: prefix_sum_original[i+1]

   So, the prefix_sum_valid can be computed using the original prefix_sum, but adjusting for the exclusion of a.

   So, for example, the sum of elements from l to r in valid_ones is:

   if a is not in ones:

      sum = prefix_sum[r+1] - prefix_sum[l]

   else:

      if l < pos and r < pos:

          sum = prefix_sum[r+1] - prefix_sum[l]

      elif l >= pos:

          sum = prefix_sum[r+2] - prefix_sum[l+1]

      else:

          sum = (prefix_sum[pos] - prefix_sum[l]) + (prefix_sum[r+2] - prefix_sum[pos+1])

   This seems complicated, but manageable.

   So, the steps are:

   For a given a:

   1. Check if a is in ones. Let's call this is_a_in_ones.

   2. Compute the valid_ones list's prefix_sum as follows:

      if is_a_in_ones:

          pos_in_ones = bisect.bisect_left(ones, a)

          def get_valid_sum(l, r):

              if l > r:

                  return 0

              if r < pos_in_ones:

                  return prefix_sum[r+1] - prefix_sum[l]

              elif l >= pos_in_ones:

                  return prefix_sum[r+2] - prefix_sum[l+1]

              else:

                  left_sum = prefix_sum[pos_in_ones] - prefix_sum[l]

                  right_sum = prefix_sum[r+2] - prefix_sum[pos_in_ones +1]

                  return left_sum + right_sum

      else:

          def get_valid_sum(l, r):

              return prefix_sum[r+1] - prefix_sum[l]

   But this requires implementing a function to compute the sum for a range in valid_ones, which can be done using the original prefix_sum and adjusting for the exclusion of a.

   So, during the computation of sum_left and sum_right for a given l and r:

   sum_left = a * l - get_valid_sum(pos - l, pos -1)

   sum_right = get_valid_sum(pos, pos + r -1) - a * r

   But this requires careful implementation.

   This seems feasible, but the code will be quite complex.

   Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with this method, even though the code will be complex.

   So, the code outline is:

   Precompute the ones list and prefix_sum.

   For each a in 0..n-1:

      is_a_in_ones = binary search in ones for a.

      initial_collected = 1 if is_a_in_ones else 0.

      req = k - initial_collected.

      if req <=0:

          cost = 0

      else:

          valid_ones_count = len(ones) - is_a_in_ones

          m_existing = min(req, valid_ones_count)

          remaining = req - m_existing

          if remaining > maxChanges:

              continue

          else:

              # Compute sum_d for valid_ones list.

              # Implement the logic to compute sum_d.

              # ...

              # Compute sum_d.

              total_cost = sum_d + 2 * remaining

              # update the minimal total_cost.

   So, the code for sum_d is the most complex part.

   Now, let's try to implement this.

   First, precompute the ones list and prefix_sum.

   Then, for each a:

   check if a is in ones.

   Then, compute the valid_ones list's sum_d.

   To compute sum_d for valid_ones:

   if is_a_in_ones:

       pos_in_ones = bisect.bisect_left(ones, a)

       # valid_ones is ones without a.

       # So, the valid_ones list is ones[0..pos_in_ones-1] + ones[pos_in_ones+1..]

       # So, the len(valid_ones) is len(ones) -1.

       # Now, compute the insertion position of a in valid_ones.

       # But a is not in valid_ones.

       # The insertion position in valid_ones is the same as pos_in_ones in the original list.

       # Because valid_ones is the original list minus a.

       # So, in valid_ones, a would be inserted at pos_in_ones.

       # So, pos = pos_in_ones.

       # But valid_ones has len(ones) -1 elements.

       # So, the left_count is pos_in_ones (number of elements <=a in valid_ones).

       # right_count is len(valid_ones) - pos_in_ones.

       left_count = pos_in_ones

       right_count = len(ones) - 1 - pos_in_ones

   else:

       # valid_ones is ones.

       pos = bisect.bisect_left(ones, a)

       left_count = pos

       right_count = len(ones) - pos

   Then, compute l_min and l_max.

   l_min = max(0, m_existing - right_count)

   l_max = min(left_count, m_existing)

   The possible l values are from l_min to l_max.

   For each l in this range:

       r = m_existing - l

       sum_left = a * l - sum of l elements from valid_ones[0..pos-1]

       sum_right = sum of r elements from valid_ones[pos..pos + r -1] - a * r

       total_sum = sum_left + sum_right

   The minimal total_sum is the sum_d.

   The challenge is to compute the sum of l elements from the left and r elements from the right in the valid_ones list.

   To compute this sum, we need to use the original prefix_sum and adjust for the exclusion of a.

   For example, if is_a_in_ones:

       sum of elements from valid_ones[0..x] is:

           if x < pos_in_ones: prefix_sum[x+1]

           else: prefix_sum[x+2] - prefix_sum[pos_in_ones +1]

   But this requires careful handling.

   So, the code will need helper functions to compute the sum of elements in the valid_ones list from l to r.

   Let's implement this.

   So, the code for sum_left and sum_right:

   if is_a_in_ones:

       # valid_ones is ones without a.

       # left elements are ones[0..pos_in_ones-1]

       # right elements are ones[pos_in_ones+1..]

       # So, to get the left part in valid_ones:

       # l elements from the left of valid_ones are the first l elements of ones[0..pos_in_ones-1]

       # sum_left = a * l - sum(ones[0..pos_in_ones-1][0..l-1])

       # sum_left = a * l - (prefix_sum[pos_in_ones] - prefix_sum[pos_in_ones - l])

       # Similarly, sum_right = sum(ones[pos_in_ones+1..pos_in_ones+1 + r-1]) - a * r

       # sum_right = (prefix_sum[pos_in_ones+1 + r] - prefix_sum[pos_in_ones+1]) - a * r

       # But we need to check if the indices are valid.

       # For sum_left:

       if l >0:

           start = pos_in_ones - l

           end = pos_in_ones -1

           if start <0:

               start =0

           sum_left_val = a * l - (prefix_sum[end+1] - prefix_sum[start])

       else:

           sum_left_val =0

       # For sum_right:

       if r >0:

           start = pos_in_ones +1

           end = start + r -1

           if end >= len(ones):

               end = len(ones) -1

           sum_right_val = (prefix_sum[end+1] - prefix_sum[start]) - a * r

       else:

           sum_right_val =0

   else:

       # valid_ones is ones.

       # sum_left = a * l - sum(ones[0..pos-1][pos - l..pos-1])

       # sum_left = a * l - (prefix_sum[pos] - prefix_sum[pos - l])

       # sum_right = sum(ones[pos..pos + r -1]) - a * r

       # sum_right = (prefix_sum[pos + r] - prefix_sum[pos]) - a * r

       if l >0:

           start = pos - l

           end = pos -1

           if start <0:

               start =0

           sum_left_val = a * l - (prefix_sum[end+1] - prefix_sum[start])

       else:

           sum_left_val =0

       if r >0:

           start = pos

           end = pos + r -1

           if end >= len(ones):

               end = len(ones) -1

           sum_right_val = (prefix_sum[end+1] - prefix_sum[start]) - a * r

       else:

           sum_right_val =0

   But this code is not handling all edge cases, such as when l exceeds the available left elements, or r exceeds the available right elements.

   However, since l and r are computed based on l_min and l_max, which ensure that l <= left_count and r <= right_count, this should not happen.

   So, the code should be safe.

   So, putting this all together, the code for sum_d would loop through l in l_min to l_max, compute the sum_left and sum_right for each l, and select the minimal sum.

   The minimal sum_d is the minimal sum_left + sum_right over all possible l in the valid range.

   Once sum_d is computed, the total_cost is sum_d + 2 * remaining.

   The code will need to compute this for each a and track the minimal total_cost.

   Finally, the code returns the minimal total_cost, or -1 if no a is valid (but the problem states that sum(nums) + maxChanges >=k, so there must be a valid a).

   This approach should work, but the code will be quite complex.

   Now, let's test this approach with the examples.

   Example 1:

   nums = [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1], k=3, maxChanges=1

   ones = [0,1,5,6,9]

   For a=1 (nums[a] is 1):

   initial_collected =1, req=2.

   valid_ones_count = 5-1=4.

   m_existing = min(2,4) =2.

   remaining=0.

   sum_d is sum of the 2 smallest distances in valid_ones (0,5,6,9) to a=1.

   valid_ones are [0,5,6,9] (since a=1 is in ones, so valid_ones is [0,5,6,9]).

   The distances are 1-0=1, 5-1=4, 6-1=5, 9-1=8.

   The two smallest are 1 and 4. sum_d=5.

   So, total_cost=5 + 0*2 =5. But the example output is 3.

   Wait, this suggests that the approach is incorrect.

   Oh, wait, in the example, the output is 3, but according to this approach, the sum_d would be 5, leading to a total cost of 5, which is not matching.

   So, there's a mistake in the approach.

   What's wrong here?

   Let's re-examine the example.

   In example 1, the optimal a is 1.

   The initial_collected is 1. req=2.

   The valid_ones are [0,5,6,9].

   The two smallest distances are 0 to 1 (distance 1), and 5 to 1 (distance 4). Sum is 5.

   But according to the example, the total moves are 3.

   So, this suggests that the approach is incorrect.

   What's the discrepancy?

   Ah, because the approach assumes that the existing 1s are collected via swaps, but in the example, the existing 1s are not collected via swaps. Instead, the example uses a combination of change and swaps.

   So, the approach is missing something.

   Wait, in the example, after the initial collection, the existing 1s are at 0,5,6,9.

   But the example uses a change to create a 1 at 2, then swaps to collect it. So, the existing 1s are not used.

   So, the approach's assumption that existing 1s are collected first is incorrect.

   So, the mistake is that the approach assumes that existing 1s are collected first, but it's possible that created 1s are cheaper to collect than existing 1s.

   For example, in the example, the existing 1s are at 0 (distance 1), 5 (distance 4), 6 (distance 5), 9 (distance 8).

   The cost to collect the existing 1 at 0 is 1 move (swap from 0 to 1).

   But in the example, the code creates a 1 at 2 (cost 1 move for change), then swaps it to 1 (cost 1 move). So, total cost 2 for this 1.

   But the existing 1 at 0 could be collected for 1 move.

   So, why is the example not collecting the existing 1 at 0?

   Because the example's optimal path uses the created 1 and some swaps.

   So, the approach's logic of collecting existing 1s first is incorrect.

   So, the approach is flawed.

   This indicates that the initial approach is incorrect, and the model needs to be revised.

   So, what's the error in the initial approach?

   The initial approach assumes that existing 1s are collected first, but created 1s may have a lower cost per 1.

   For example, created 1s can be placed at positions that are very close to a, leading to lower cost.

   So, the initial approach's model of collecting existing 1s first and then created 1s is incorrect.

   The correct approach should consider that created 1s may be cheaper than existing 1s, so the optimal solution may involve creating 1s and collecting them, even if there are existing 1s.

   So, the model needs to consider all possible combinations of existing and created 1s, which makes the problem much more complex.

   This suggests that the initial approach is incorrect, and a new approach is needed.

   So, the problem is more complex than initially thought.

   Let's think differently.

   Each 1 that is collected can be either:

   - An existing 1, which requires moving it to a via swaps. The cost is the distance.

   - A created 1, which requires a change (1 move) and then moving it to a via swaps. The cost is 1 + distance.

   So, for each 1 that is collected, the cost is min( existing_cost, created_cost ).

   But this is not exactly correct, because created 1s can be placed anywhere (except a), so the created_cost for a 1 is 1 + d, where d is the distance from a to the created position.

   The optimal created 1s would be placed as close as possible to a, leading to a cost of 1 + 0 (if possible), but since j cannot be a, the minimal created_cost is 1 + 1 (distance 1).

   So, for a created 1, the minimal cost is 2.

   So, for any existing 1 with distance d, it's better to collect it if d <= 2.

   For d=1, existing cost is 1, created cost is 2.

   For d=2, existing cost is 2, created cost is 3.

   So, existing 1s with d <=2 are better collected as existing.

   For existing 1s with d>2, it's better to create a 1 and collect it (cost 2) rather than collect the existing 1 (cost d).

   So, the optimal strategy is:

   For each existing 1, collect it if its distance to a is <=2. Otherwise, ignore it and create a 1.

   But how to model this.

   So, the problem becomes:

   For a given a, the optimal way to collect k ones is:

   - Collect as many existing 1s as possible with distance <=2.

   - The remaining 1s are created, with cost 2 per 1.

   But the number of created 1s is limited by maxChanges.

   So, for each a:

   1. Collect the initial 1 (if any).

   2. Collect existing 1s with distance <=2, up to (k - initial_collected).

   3. The remaining 1s are created, up to maxChanges.

   4. If the total collected is >=k, compute the cost.

   But this is a simplification and may not capture all cases.

   Alternatively, for each a, the optimal cost is the sum of the minimal cost for each of the k 1s, which can be either existing or created.

   But how to compute this.

   This seems like a problem that requires dynamic programming, but with large constraints (n=1e5, k=1e5), which is not feasible.

   So, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows:

   For each a, the minimal cost to collect k ones is the sum of the k smallest costs, where each cost is either:

   - For an existing 1: distance from a.

   - For a created 1: 1 + distance from a (but can be placed anywhere except a, so the minimal cost is 2 per created 1).

   So, for each a, the minimal cost is the sum of the k smallest values among:

   - existing distances (excluding a's initial 1)

   - created costs (2, up to maxChanges times).

   So, for a given a:

   initial_collected = 1 if nums[a] is 1 else 0.

   req = k - initial_collected.

   if req <=0: cost is 0.

   else:

      existing_distances = [abs(x -a) for x in ones if x !=a]

      created_costs = [2] * maxChanges

      merged = sorted(existing_distances + created_costs)

      sum_d = sum(merged[:req])

      if len(merged) >= req and (number of created_costs used is <= maxChanges):

          total_cost = sum_d

      else:

          not possible.

   But this approach is not correct because the created_costs can be used up to maxChanges times, but in the merged list, the created_costs are considered as individual elements. So, if we take min(req, maxChanges) created_costs, and the rest from existing_distances.

   But this approach would require merging the existing_distances and created_costs, and then selecting the smallest req elements, with the constraint that no more than maxChanges created_costs are used.

   This is a classic problem of selecting the smallest req elements from two lists, with a constraint on the number of elements from the second list.

   This can be solved with a two-pointer approach.

   Let's think:

   Sort the existing_distances in increasing order.

   Sort the created_costs in increasing order (which is 2 repeated maxChanges times).

   Then, use two pointers to select the minimal sum, ensuring that the number of created_costs used does not exceed maxChanges.

   This is similar to merging two sorted arrays with a constraint.

   But how to do this efficiently.

   For example:

   existing_distances = [1,4,5,8], sorted.

   created_costs = [2,2,2,2] (assuming maxChanges=4).

   req=3.

   The minimal sum is 1+2+2=5 (using 1 existing and 2 created).

   So, the approach is to select the minimal elements from the two lists, with the constraint that no more than maxChanges created_costs are used.

   This can be done with a two-pointer approach:

   - i is the number of existing_distances used.

   - j is the number of created_costs used.

   - i + j = req.

   - j <= maxChanges.

   The goal is to find the minimal sum of the first i existing_distances and j created_costs, where i + j = req and j <= maxChanges.

   The minimal sum is the minimal over all possible i and j.

   So, for each possible i (from max(0, req - maxChanges) to min(req, len(existing_distances))), j = req -i.

   For each i in this range, compute the sum of the first i existing_distances and the first j created_costs.

   The minimal sum is the minimal of these.

   This approach is feasible.

   So, for each a:

   1. Compute initial_collected.

   2. req = k - initial_collected.

   3. If req <=0: cost is 0.

   4. Else:

      a. existing_distances = sorted list of |x -a| for x in ones (x !=a).

      b. created_costs = [2] * maxChanges.

      c. sort existing_distances and created_costs.

      d. i can range from max(0, req - maxChanges) to min(req, len(existing_distances)).

      e. For each i in this range:

          j = req -i

          if j > maxChanges: skip.

          sum_d = sum(existing_distances[:i]) + sum(created_costs[:j])

          track the minimal sum_d.

      f. The minimal sum_d is the cost for a.

   So, the code for each a would be:

   existing_distances = sorted([abs(x -a) for x in ones if x !=a])

   created_costs = [2] * maxChanges

   existing_len = len(existing_distances)

   created_len = maxChanges

   i_min = max(0, req - created_len)

   i_max = min(req, existing_len)

   min_sum = infinity

   for i in range(i_min, i_max +1):

       j = req -i

       if j <0 or j > created_len:

           continue

       sum_existing = sum(existing_distances[:i]) if i >0 else 0

       sum_created = sum(created_costs[:j]) if j >0 else 0

       total = sum_existing + sum_created

       if total < min_sum:

           min_sum = total

   if min_sum is still infinity: no solution.

   else: total_cost = min_sum.

   But this approach requires sorting existing_distances for each a, which is O(m log m) per a, and m can be up to 1e5. So, for n=1e5, this is O(n m log m), which is not feasible.

   So, this approach is not feasible for large n.

   So, the problem requires a different approach.

   Let's think of the following:

   For each a, the existing_distances are the distances of the existing 1s (excluding a) to a.

   The existing_distances can be sorted by distance.

   The created_costs are 2 per created 1, up to maxChanges.

   So, the minimal sum is the sum of the first i existing_distances (sorted) and j created_costs (each 2), where i + j = req and j <= maxChanges.

   The optimal i is the maximum possible i such that i <= req and j = req -i <= maxChanges.

   So, i can be from max(0, req - maxChanges) to min(req, len(existing_distances)).

   For each a, the sum of the first i existing_distances can be computed quickly if the existing_distances are sorted.

   But for each a, the existing_distances are different, and sorting them for each a is O(m log m) time, which is not feasible.

   So, the key is to find a way to compute the sum of the first i existing_distances for each a without sorting for each a.

   This seems to bring us back to the initial approach of using the original ones list and binary search to compute the sum of the i smallest distances.

   But how to integrate the created_costs into this model.

   So, the correct approach is:

   For each a:

   1. Compute initial_collected.

   2. req = k - initial_collected.

   3. If req <=0: cost is 0.

   4. Else:

      a. Compute the sum of the i smallest existing_distances for i up to min(req, len(existing_distances)).

      b. Compute the sum of j = req -i created_costs (each 2), j <= maxChanges.

      c. Find the minimal sum over valid i.

   So, the sum of the i smallest existing_distances can be computed using the initial approach (binary search and prefix sums), and the sum of j created_costs is 2*j.

   So, the code for each a would be:

   sum_existing = sum of i smallest existing_distances.

   sum_created = 2 * j.

   total_cost = sum_existing + sum_created.

   The goal is to find the minimal total_cost over i and j where i + j = req and j <= maxChanges.

   So, for each a, the code would:

   - Compute the sum_existing for i = max(0, req - maxChanges) to min(req, len(existing_distances)).

   - For each i in this range, j = req -i.

   - If j <= maxChanges, compute total_cost.

   The minimal total_cost for a is the minimal of these.

   So, the code for each a is:

   existing_len = len(existing_distances) = len(ones) - (1 if a is in ones else 0)

   i_min = max(0, req - maxChanges)

   i_max = min(req, existing_len)

   if i_min > i_max: no solution for this a.

   else:

       for i in i_min to i_max:

           j = req -i
