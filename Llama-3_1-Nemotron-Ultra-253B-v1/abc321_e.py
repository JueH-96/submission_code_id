Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where for each test case, given N, X, K, I have to find the number of vertices at exactly distance K from X in this special tree. The tree structure is such that each node i (for i >=2) is connected to floor(i/2). So the tree is a binary heap-like structure, right? Like, each node's parent is floor(i/2). So node 2's parent is 1, node 3's parent is 1, node 4's parent is 2, node 5's parent is 2, etc. So the tree is a binary tree where each node has up to two children.

The problem is to find the number of nodes at exactly distance K from X. Let's think about how the distance works here. The distance between two nodes is the number of edges in their path. So for example, the distance from X to itself is 0. Then, its parent and children would be at distance 1. Then their parents and children (excluding X) would be at distance 2, etc.

But how do we model this for large N, up to 1e18? Because for each test case, we can't traverse the tree. We need a mathematical approach or some pattern.

Let's start by understanding the structure. The tree is a binary heap, so each node's ancestors are the path up to the root (node 1), and each node can have up to two children. So for any node, the subtree is a binary tree. But the nodes are arranged in a way that their children are 2i and 2i+1.

The key observation here is that the distance from X to another node Y is equal to the depth of X plus the depth of Y minus twice the depth of their lowest common ancestor (LCA). Wait, maybe that's not the easiest way. Alternatively, the distance between X and Y is the number of steps you need to move up from X to the LCA, then down to Y. So, for example, if X is 2 and Y is 5: X is 2, parent is 1. Y is 5, parent is 2. So the LCA is 2. So the distance is (distance from X to LCA) + (distance from Y to LCA) = 0 + 1 = 1. Which matches the sample input where in the first sample, when X=2, K=1, the nodes include 5.

Hmm. So the distance between X and Y is the sum of their depths minus twice the depth of their LCA. But how to compute that efficiently?

Alternatively, maybe we can model the path from X to Y as moving up to some ancestor and then down. So for each node Y, the distance from X is the number of steps to reach the LCA from X, plus the number of steps from Y to the LCA. So for each Y, the distance is (depth(X) - depth(LCA)) + (depth(Y) - depth(LCA)) = depth(X) + depth(Y) - 2*depth(LCA).

But how to find the LCA of X and Y? Well, the LCA is the common ancestor of X and Y that is furthest from the root. For the binary tree structure, the path from a node to the root is determined by repeatedly dividing by 2. So the LCA of two nodes can be found by finding the common prefix in their binary representations. But maybe there's a simpler way here.

Alternatively, for any node Y, the path from X to Y is determined by moving up the tree from X until reaching the LCA, then moving down to Y. So the distance is the sum of the steps up from X to LCA and steps down from LCA to Y.

But how do we model all possible Ys that are at distance K from X?

This seems complicated. Let's think of the problem as layers around X. The nodes at distance 0 are just X. The nodes at distance 1 are X's parent and X's children (if they exist). The nodes at distance 2 are the parent's parent, the parent's other child (if any), the children's children, etc. But for large N, enumerating these is impossible. So we need a mathematical formula.

Wait, perhaps we can model the problem as a BFS starting from X. Each level of BFS corresponds to the nodes at a certain distance. The number of nodes at each level is the answer for K. But again, for large N and K up to 1e18, we can't simulate BFS. So we need a way to compute the number of nodes at distance K from X in this tree structure.

Let's think about the structure of the tree. The tree is a binary heap, so each node can have up to two children. The nodes are arranged such that the parent of i is floor(i/2). So the root is 1. The left child of i is 2i, the right child is 2i+1.

The distance from X to another node Y can be found by the path from X to Y. Let's consider the path from X to Y. The path must go through the LCA of X and Y. So the distance is (depth(X) - depth(LCA)) + (depth(Y) - depth(LCA)) = depth(X) + depth(Y) - 2*depth(LCA).

But how to find the number of Y such that this distance equals K.

Alternatively, for each possible LCA, we can compute how many Y's in the subtree of the LCA (but not in the path from X to LCA) contribute to the distance K.

Alternatively, maybe we can split the problem into two parts: nodes that are in the subtree of X, and nodes that are outside (ancestors or in other subtrees).

Wait, perhaps the nodes at distance K from X can be found in two directions: moving up towards the root and then possibly down into other subtrees, or moving down into the subtree of X.

But this is getting a bit vague. Let's try to find a pattern or formula.

Let's first find the depth of X. The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node. For example, node 1 has depth 0. Nodes 2 and 3 have depth 1. Nodes 4,5,6,7 have depth 2, etc. So the depth of a node i is floor(log2(i)) ? Wait, for node 2, log2(2) is 1, so depth is 1. For node 4, log2(4) is 2, depth is 2. So yes, the depth of node i is the floor of log2(i), but perhaps there's a better way to compute it. Alternatively, the depth can be computed by finding the highest power of 2 that is <= i. For example, for i=5, the highest power is 4 (2^2), so depth is 2.

Wait, the depth of node i is the number of times you can divide i by 2 until you reach 1. For example, node 8: 8/2=4, /2=2, /2=1. So 3 steps, depth 3. So yes, depth is log2(i) rounded down. So depth(i) = floor(log2(i)).

But how to compute that for very large i (up to 1e18)? Well, in Python, we can compute the bit length. For example, the bit length of i is the number of bits required to represent i in binary, which is floor(log2(i)) +1. So depth(i) = (i.bit_length() -1) -1 if i is a power of two? Wait, let's see:

i=1: binary is 1, bit_length is 1. depth is 0. So depth = 1-1=0.

i=2: binary 10, bit_length 2. depth 1. 2-1=1.

i=3: binary 11, bit_length 2. depth 1.

i=4: 100, bit_length 3. depth 2.

Yes, so depth(i) = (i.bit_length() -1) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, (i.bit_length() -1) is the exponent of the highest power of two. For example, 4 is 100, bit_length 3, so 3-1=2, which is correct. So depth(i) = (i.bit_length() -1) -1? No, wait:

Wait, for i=2, bit_length is 2. 2-1=1. So depth is 1. Which is correct.

Wait, depth(i) is (i.bit_length() -1) -1? Wait, no. For i=2, (2.bit_length()-1) is 1, so 1-1=0. No, that's wrong.

Wait, maybe depth(i) is (i.bit_length() -1) -1? Let me check:

i=1: 1.bit_length()=1. (1-1) -1 = -1. No, that's not right.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's think again. The depth of node i is the number of edges from the root to the node. The root is 1, which has depth 0. The children of the root (2,3) have depth 1. Their children (4,5,6,7) have depth 2, and so on.

So for node i, the depth is the number of times you divide by 2 to reach 1. For example:

i=8: 8/2=4, 4/2=2, 2/2=1. 3 divisions, so depth 3. But 8 is 2^3, so log2(8)=3. So depth is log2(i) when i is a power of two. For numbers that are not powers of two, like 5, the depth is log2(4) = 2, since 5 is between 4 (2^2) and 8 (2^3). So the depth is floor(log2(i)).

Yes, so depth(i) = floor(log2(i)).

But in Python, how to compute floor(log2(i)) efficiently? For i=0, it's undefined, but in our problem, i starts from 1. So for i >=1, the floor of log2(i) is (i.bit_length() -1) -1 when i is a power of two? Wait, no. Wait, the bit_length of i is the number of bits required. For example:

i=1: 1 → 1 bit. bit_length is 1. log2(1) is 0. So floor(log2(i))=0 = 1-1.

i=2: 10 → 2 bits. log2(2)=1. 2-1=1.

i=3: 11 → 2 bits. log2(3) is ~1.58, floor is 1. 2-1=1.

i=4: 100 → 3 bits. log2(4)=2. 3-1=2.

So yes, floor(log2(i)) = i.bit_length() -1 -1? Wait, no. Wait, for i=1, 1.bit_length() is 1. 1-1=0. Which is correct. For i=2, 2.bit_length() is 2. 2-1=1. Correct. For i=4, 4.bit_length() is 3. 3-1=2. Correct. So yes, floor(log2(i)) = (i.bit_length() -1) -1? Wait, no. Wait, 4.bit_length() is 3. 3-1=2. Which is exactly log2(4). So floor(log2(i)) = i.bit_length() -1. Wait, wait, 3.bit_length() is 2. 2-1=1, which is floor(log2(3))=1. Yes. So yes, floor(log2(i)) = i.bit_length() -1.

Wait, no. Wait, 4.bit_length() is 3. 3-1=2. log2(4) is 2. So yes. So floor(log2(i)) is equal to (i.bit_length() -1). Wait, for i=1: 1.bit_length() is 1. 1-1=0. Correct. For i=2: 2-1=1. Correct. For i=3: 2-1=1. Correct. For i=4: 3-1=2. Correct. So yes, floor(log2(i)) = i.bit_length() -1.

So depth(i) = floor(log2(i)) = i.bit_length() -1.

So that's how we can compute the depth of any node.

Now, the distance between X and Y is depth(X) + depth(Y) - 2 * depth(LCA(X,Y)).

But how to find the number of Y such that this distance equals K.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as follows: For a given X and K, the nodes at distance K are those that can be reached by moving up some steps from X, then moving down some steps. For example, moving up to some ancestor A, then moving down into the subtree of A (but not the path from X to A). The total steps would be the steps up (depth(X) - depth(A)) plus the steps down (depth(Y) - depth(A)) = (depth(X) - depth(A)) + (depth(Y) - depth(A)) = depth(X) + depth(Y) - 2 * depth(A). We want this to equal K. So for each possible A (which is an ancestor of X), we can compute the required depth(Y) and see how many such Y exist in the subtree of A, but not on the path from X to A.

Wait, but A can be any ancestor of X, including X itself. Let's see.

Let's consider all possible ancestors A of X (including X). For each such A, the distance from X to Y is (depth(X) - depth(A)) + (depth(Y) - depth(A)) = (depth(X) + depth(Y) - 2 * depth(A)) = K. Rearranged, depth(Y) = K + 2 * depth(A) - depth(X). Let's call this target_depth.

For Y to be in the subtree of A, but not on the path from X to A (since nodes on that path would have their LCA with X being higher than A), the Y must be in the subtree of A, but not in the path from X to A. So for each A, the number of Y in the subtree of A at depth target_depth, minus those that are on the path from X to A (if any).

But how to compute this?

Alternatively, for each A, which is an ancestor of X, we can compute how many nodes in the subtree of A (including A) are at depth target_depth, but not in the path from X to A.

But perhaps this is manageable.

So the steps would be:

1. Enumerate all possible ancestors A of X (including X itself). For each A, compute the required target_depth = K + 2 * depth(A) - depth(X).

   For this target_depth, we need to find the number of nodes in the subtree of A that are at depth target_depth, but not on the path from X to A.

   Then, sum this over all possible A where target_depth >= depth(A) (since nodes in the subtree of A can't have depth less than depth(A)).

   Also, note that target_depth must be >= depth(A), otherwise there are no such nodes.

   So for each A, we need to check if target_depth >= depth(A). If not, skip.

   Also, the maximum possible depth for any node is log2(N), so target_depth must be <= log2(N) (since Y <= N).

   So for each A, compute target_depth, and if it's valid, compute the number of nodes in the subtree of A at that depth, minus the nodes that are on the path from X to A (if any).

But how to compute this?

First, let's find the possible A's. Since A is an ancestor of X, including X itself, the path from X to the root is X, parent(X), parent(parent(X)), ..., root. So the number of such A's is O(log X), which is acceptable even for large X (since X can be up to 1e18, log2(X) is about 60, so for T=1e5, total steps are 1e5 * 60 = 6e6, which is manageable).

So for each test case, we can generate all ancestors A of X, compute for each A the target_depth, and then compute the number of nodes in the subtree of A at target_depth, minus those that are on the path from X to A (if any).

Now, how to compute the number of nodes in the subtree of A at depth target_depth.

The subtree of A is all nodes that are descendants of A, including A itself. The nodes in the subtree of A at depth d (depth >= depth(A)) can be computed as follows:

The minimum depth is depth(A). For each level d >= depth(A), the number of nodes in the subtree of A at depth d is the number of nodes in the subtree of A that are at depth d.

But how to compute this?

The subtree of A is a binary tree. The root is A. At each level, the number of nodes doubles. So for depth d = depth(A) + k, the number of nodes in the subtree is min(2^k, ... ) but considering that some nodes may exceed N.

Wait, the subtree of A consists of all nodes that can be reached by descending from A. So the nodes in the subtree of A are all nodes that have A as an ancestor. So for example, the subtree of A includes A's children (2A and 2A+1), their children, etc., up to the maximum node N.

So for a given depth d (>= depth(A)), the number of nodes in the subtree of A at depth d is equal to the number of nodes in the subtree of A that are at depth d. Let's denote this as count(A, d).

To compute count(A, d):

The depth of A is da = depth(A). The target depth is d = da + k, where k >=0.

In the subtree of A, the number of nodes at depth da + k is 2^k, but only if the subtree is full. However, if the maximum node in the subtree of A at depth da +k is <= N, then the count is 2^k. Otherwise, it's the number of nodes in the subtree of A at depth d that are <= N.

Wait, but the subtree of A at depth d can be represented as a range of nodes. For example, the nodes in the subtree of A at depth da +k are the nodes that are in the subtree of A and have depth d. The subtree of A is a binary tree of height (d - da), but the nodes may be limited by N.

Alternatively, the nodes in the subtree of A at depth d can be found as follows:

The root of the subtree is A. At each level, each node has two children. So after k steps (k = d - da), the number of nodes is 2^k. However, if the maximum possible node in that level is greater than N, then the actual count is the number of nodes in that level that are <= N.

So how to compute the maximum node in the subtree of A at depth d.

Wait, the minimum node in the subtree of A at depth d is A * 2^{k}, where k = d - da. The maximum node is (A * 2^{k}) + (2^{k} -1). For example, if A is 2 (depth 1), and k=1 (d=2), then the nodes are 4 and 5. 2*2^1=4, 4 + 1 =5. So min is 4, max is 5. For k=2 (d=3), nodes are 8,9,10,11. But if N is 10, then the max node is 10, so the count is 3 (8,9,10).

So the formula for the number of nodes in the subtree of A at depth d is:

min(2^k, N - min_node +1) where min_node = A * 2^k, and max_node = A * 2^k + (2^k -1).

But wait, let's see:

The nodes in the subtree of A at depth d are the nodes that are exactly k steps below A (k = d - da). Each step, each node can have two children. So the first such node is A * 2^k (since each step multiplies by 2). The last node is A * 2^k + (2^k -1). For example, A=2, k=1: 2*2=4, 4+1=5. So nodes 4 and 5.

So the range of nodes is [A * 2^k, A * 2^k + (2^k -1)].

But this must be <= N. So the actual count is the number of nodes in this interval that are <= N.

So the count is:

max(0, min(N, A * 2^k + (2^k -1)) - A * 2^k +1 )

But this can be simplified as:

count = min(2^k, N - A * 2^k +1 )

Wait, let's compute:

The total nodes in the full subtree is 2^k. The actual nodes are from A*2^k to min(A*2^k + 2^k -1, N). So the number of nodes is max(0, min(A*2^k + 2^k -1, N) - A*2^k +1 )

Which is the same as:

max(0, min(2^k, N - A*2^k +1 ))

Because:

A*2^k + 2^k -1 = A*2^k + (2^k -1) = (A +1)*2^k -1.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute:

start = A << k

end = start + (1 << k) - 1

if end > N:

   count = max(0, N - start +1 )

else:

   count = 1 << k

But this is equivalent to:

count = max(0, min(end, N) - start +1 )

So for each A and d, we compute k = d - da. If k <0, then count is zero. Otherwise, start = A * (2^k), end = start + (2^k) -1. The count is max(0, min(end, N) - start +1 ) if start <= N, else 0.

But how to compute this efficiently for very large A and k, given that N can be up to 1e18?

We need to compute 2^k, but when k is up to, say, 60 (since da can be up to 60 for X up to 1e18), 2^60 is manageable as a Python integer.

But when k is large, 2^k can be larger than 1e18, which would cause start to be larger than N, leading to count zero.

So the steps for count(A, d):

da = depth(A)

k = d - da

if k <0: return 0

start = A * (2 ** k)

if start > N: return 0

end = start + (2 **k ) -1

if end > N:

   return N - start +1

else:

   return 2**k

But how to compute this efficiently in Python for very large exponents? Because 2**k can be up to 2^60, which is about 1e18, which is manageable.

But when k is 60, 2**60 is 1e18, which is a 1 followed by 18 zeros. So in Python, this is okay.

Now, the next part is, for each A (ancestor of X), compute the target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X, where depth_X is the depth of X.

Wait, depth_X is the depth of X, which is (X.bit_length() -1). So for each A, which is an ancestor of X, da is depth(A). Then target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X.

We need to compute the number of nodes in the subtree of A at depth target_depth, but subtract those nodes that are on the path from X to A.

Wait, the nodes on the path from X to A are the nodes that are ancestors of X, but in this case, since A is an ancestor of X, the path from X to A is X, parent(X), parent(parent(X)), ..., A. So the nodes on this path are the ancestors of X up to A.

But the nodes in the subtree of A at target_depth that are on the path from X to A would be the node at depth target_depth that is on the path from X to A. Wait, but the path from X to A is a single path. So for each A, the path from X to A is a single line. So in the subtree of A, the nodes on the path from X to A are the nodes that are in the path from X to A. So for example, if A is the parent of X, then the path from X to A is just X and A. But in the subtree of A, the nodes at target_depth would be those in the subtree of A at that depth. But the nodes on the path from X to A are only X (if X is in the subtree of A, which it is), but X's depth is depth_X, which may be different from target_depth.

Wait, perhaps the nodes on the path from X to A are those that are in the path from X to A, which is a single line. For example, if A is X's parent, then the path from X to A is X → A. So in the subtree of A, the nodes at target_depth would be those in the subtree of A at that depth. But the nodes on the path from X to A are X (if X is at target_depth), but X's depth is depth_X. So if target_depth is not equal to depth_X, then there are no nodes on the path from X to A in the subtree of A at target_depth.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's think again.

For a given A (ancestor of X), the nodes in the subtree of A at target_depth are those Y where Y is in the subtree of A and depth(Y) = target_depth.

We need to subtract the nodes that are on the path from X to A. But the path from X to A is the path from X up to A. So the nodes on this path are X, parent(X), parent(parent(X)), ..., A.

But these nodes have varying depths. For example, X's depth is depth_X, parent(X) has depth depth_X -1, etc., down to A's depth da.

So the nodes on the path from X to A have depths ranging from depth_X down to da.

So for target_depth to be equal to any of these depths, the nodes in the subtree of A at target_depth that are on the path from X to A would be the node that is exactly at depth target_depth on the path from X to A.

But how many such nodes are there? For example, if target_depth is equal to the depth of some node on the path from X to A, then there is exactly one node (the one on the path) in the subtree of A at target_depth. Otherwise, there are none.

So for each A, the number of nodes to subtract is 1 if target_depth is in the set of depths of the path from X to A, and 0 otherwise.

Wait, but the path from X to A is a single path. So for each node on that path, their depth is decreasing by 1 each step. So the depths are depth_X, depth_X -1, ..., da.

So target_depth must be one of these values for there to be a node on the path. So if target_depth is in [da, depth_X], then there is exactly one node on the path from X to A that is at depth target_depth. Otherwise, there are none.

But wait, the path from X to A is X → parent(X) → ... → A. The depths of these nodes are depth_X, depth_X-1, ..., da. So if target_depth is in this range, then there is exactly one node on the path (the one at that depth). Otherwise, there are none.

So for each A, the number of nodes to subtract is 1 if target_depth is between da and depth_X (inclusive), and 0 otherwise.

But how to compute this?

So for each A:

Compute target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X.

We need to check if target_depth is in the range [da, depth_X]. If so, then there is exactly one node on the path from X to A that is in the subtree of A at target_depth. Otherwise, there are none.

Wait, but the node on the path from X to A that is at depth target_depth would be the one that is exactly at that depth. For example, if target_depth is depth_X - s, then the node is the one s steps up from X. But since A is an ancestor of X, and the path from X to A is a certain length, the node at target_depth on the path from X to A would be in the subtree of A only if target_depth >= da.

Because the path from X to A is X's parent, etc., up to A. So the node at target_depth on the path is the ancestor of X that is at depth target_depth. But since A is an ancestor of X, and target_depth >= da (since A is at depth da), this node is in the subtree of A only if target_depth >= da.

Wait, the subtree of A includes all descendants of A, including A itself. So the node at depth target_depth on the path from X to A is in the subtree of A if and only if target_depth >= da.

But target_depth is computed as K + 2*da - depth_X. So for this to be >= da, we have:

K + 2*da - depth_X >= da → K >= depth_X - da.

But depth_X - da is the number of steps from X to A. Let's call this s. So s = depth_X - da.

So the condition is K >= s.

But K can be anything. So for each A, the node on the path from X to A at depth target_depth is in the subtree of A if and only if target_depth >= da. Which is equivalent to K + 2*da - depth_X >= da → K >= depth_X - da.

But depth_X - da is s, the number of steps from X to A. So for each A, s = depth_X - da.

So the condition is K >= s.

So for each A, the node on the path from X to A at depth target_depth is present in the subtree of A at target_depth only if K >= s. And in that case, there is exactly one such node.

So the number of nodes to subtract is 1 if:

1. target_depth is within the range [da, depth_X], which is equivalent to da <= target_depth <= depth_X.

But target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X.

So substituting:

da <= K + 2*da - depth_X <= depth_X

Rearranged:

Left inequality: da <= K + 2*da - depth_X → 0 <= K + da - depth_X → K >= depth_X - da.

Right inequality: K + 2*da - depth_X <= depth_X → K + 2*da <= 2*depth_X → K <= 2*depth_X - 2*da.

But depth_X - da is s, the number of steps from X to A. So the left inequality is K >= s, and the right inequality is K <= 2*(depth_X - da) → K <= 2s.

So for the node on the path from X to A to be at depth target_depth and in the subtree of A, we need K >= s and K <= 2s. But wait, target_depth is K + 2*da - depth_X = K - s + da. Since da is the depth of A, and s = depth_X - da, target_depth = K - s + da = K - (depth_X - da) + da = K - depth_X + 2*da.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's take an example.

Suppose X is at depth 3, A is at depth 1 (so s = 3 -1 =2). Then target_depth = K + 2*1 -3 = K -1.

For the node on the path from X to A to be in the subtree of A at target_depth, target_depth must be >= da (1), and <= depth_X (3).

So K-1 >=1 → K >=2.

And K-1 <=3 → K <=4.

So for K between 2 and 4, the node on the path from X to A is present in the subtree of A at target_depth.

But the node on the path from X to A at depth target_depth is the one s' steps up from X, where s' = depth_X - target_depth.

In this case, s' = 3 - (K-1) = 4 - K.

So for K=2, s'=2, which is X's parent's parent (A is at depth 1, which is X's parent's parent? Wait, in this example, X is at depth 3. So X's parent is depth 2, parent's parent is depth 1 (A), and parent's parent's parent is depth 0. So in this example, A is at depth 1, which is the parent's parent of X. So the path from X to A is X → parent(X) (depth 2) → A (depth 1). So the nodes on the path have depths 3, 2, 1.

So target_depth for A is K-1. For K=2, target_depth is 1. So the node at depth 1 on the path is A itself. So in the subtree of A at depth 1, there is exactly one node (A), which is on the path. So when computing the count for A, we need to subtract 1 if the target_depth is 1, which is the case when K=2.

So in this case, the count for A is the number of nodes in the subtree of A at depth 1 (which is 1, since A is at depth 1 and the subtree of A at depth 1 is just A), minus 1 (the node on the path), so zero. But that's not right. Wait, the target_depth is 1. The nodes in the subtree of A at depth 1 are just A. So the count is 1. But we subtract 1 if the node is on the path. So the result is 0. So for this A and K=2, the contribution is zero.

But how does this fit into the overall problem?

This suggests that for each A, the contribution is the count of nodes in the subtree of A at target_depth, minus 1 if the target_depth is in the path from X to A.

So the algorithm is:

For each test case:

1. Compute depth_X = X.bit_length() -1.

2. For each ancestor A of X (including X itself):

   a. Compute da = depth(A) = A.bit_length() -1.

   b. s = depth_X - da (number of steps from X to A).

   c. Compute target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X.

   d. Check if target_depth >= da (since nodes in the subtree of A can't have depth less than da).

   e. Also, check if target_depth <= depth_X (since the node on the path from X to A can't have depth greater than depth_X).

   Wait, no. The node on the path from X to A has depth in the range [da, depth_X]. So target_depth must be in that range for there to be a node on the path.

   So the condition for the node on the path to be in the subtree of A at target_depth is:

   da <= target_depth <= depth_X.

   But target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X.

   So substituting:

   da <= K + 2*da - depth_X <= depth_X.

   Let's rearrange:

   Left inequality: da <= K + 2*da - depth_X → 0 <= K + da - depth_X → K >= depth_X - da → K >= s.

   Right inequality: K + 2*da - depth_X <= depth_X → K <= 2*depth_X - 2*da → K <= 2*s.

   So for the node on the path to be present, K must be between s and 2*s.

   So if K >= s and K <= 2*s, then there is a node on the path from X to A in the subtree of A at target_depth. So we need to subtract 1 from the count.

   Additionally, the target_depth must be >= da, which is already covered by K >= s.

   Because target_depth = K - s + da. Since s = depth_X - da, target_depth = K - (depth_X - da) + da = K - depth_X + 2*da.

   Wait, maybe it's easier to compute:

   For the node on the path from X to A to be at target_depth, target_depth must be equal to the depth of some node on the path. The depths of the nodes on the path are depth_X, depth_X -1, ..., da.

   So target_depth must be in that range. So da <= target_depth <= depth_X.

   So for each A, after computing target_depth, we check if it's in this range. If yes, then there is exactly one node on the path from X to A in the subtree of A at target_depth. So subtract 1.

   So the steps for each A are:

   Compute da = depth(A).

   target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X.

   If target_depth < da → no nodes in the subtree of A at that depth. So skip.

   If target_depth > depth_X → no node on the path from X to A is at that depth. So subtract 0.

   Else → subtract 1.

   So the number of nodes to subtract is 1 if (target_depth >= da and target_depth <= depth_X) → which is equivalent to (K >= s and K <= 2*s), since s = depth_X - da.

   So for each A, the contribution to the answer is:

   count_in_subtree = compute the number of nodes in the subtree of A at target_depth.

   subtract = 1 if (target_depth >= da and target_depth <= depth_X) → which is (K >= s and K <= 2*s).

   contribution = max(0, count_in_subtree - subtract)

   But wait, if count_in_subtree is zero, then subtract can't be applied. So contribution is max(0, count_in_subtree - subtract) if count_in_subtree >0.

   So the total contribution from A is:

   if target_depth >= da:

      compute count_in_subtree.

      subtract = 1 if (target_depth <= depth_X) and (K >= s and K <= 2*s) → which is equivalent to (target_depth <= depth_X).

      but target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X. So target_depth <= depth_X → K + 2*da - depth_X <= depth_X → K <= 2*(depth_X - da) → K <= 2*s.

      So subtract is 1 if (target_depth >= da) and (target_depth <= depth_X) → which is (K >= s and K <= 2*s).

      So subtract = 1 if (K >= s and K <= 2*s) and (target_depth >= da).

      But target_depth >= da is equivalent to K >= s.

      So subtract is 1 if (K >= s and K <= 2*s).

      So contribution = count_in_subtree - subtract.

      but contribution can't be negative, so max(0, contribution).

   else:

      contribution = 0.

   So the steps for each A are:

   compute da = depth(A)

   s = depth_X - da

   target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X

   if target_depth < da:

      continue

   if target_depth > depth_X:

      subtract = 0

   else:

      subtract = 1 if (K >= s and K <= 2*s) else 0

   count_in_subtree = compute as per earlier

   contribution = max(0, count_in_subtree - subtract)

   add contribution to the answer.

   So the algorithm is:

   For each test case:

      X, N, K = input

      depth_X = X.bit_length() -1

      ans = 0

      current = X

      while True:

          da = current.bit_length() -1

          s = depth_X - da

          target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X

          if target_depth < da:

              # no nodes in subtree of current at target_depth

              pass

          else:

              # compute count_in_subtree

              k = target_depth - da

              start = current << k

              if start > N:

                  count = 0

              else:

                  end = start + (1 << k) -1

                  if end > N:

                      count = N - start +1

                  else:

                      count = 1 << k

              # compute subtract

              if target_depth > depth_X:

                  subtract = 0

              else:

                  if K >= s and K <= 2*s:

                      subtract = 1

                  else:

                      subtract = 0

              contribution = max(0, count - subtract)

              ans += contribution

          # move to parent

          if current == 1:

              break

          current = current // 2

      print(ans)

   Wait, but the ancestors of X are X, parent(X), parent(parent(X)), etc., up to 1. So the loop starts with current = X, then current = parent(current) until current is 1.

   But wait, when current is 1, its parent is 0, but we stop at 1.

   So the loop should iterate for all ancestors of X, including X itself. So the loop starts with current = X, and in each iteration, processes current, then moves to parent(current), until current is 1, which is processed, then loop ends.

   Now, let's test this algorithm against the sample input.

   Sample Input 1:

   5

   10 2 0

   10 2 1

   10 2 2

   10 2 3

   10 2 4

   Sample Output 1:

   1

   3

   4

   2

   0

   Let's take the first test case: N=10, X=2, K=0.

   depth_X = 2.bit_length() -1 = 2-1=1.

   The ancestors of 2 are 2, 1.

   Processing each ancestor:

   For current=2:

      da = 2.bit_length()-1 =1.

      s = 1 -1 =0.

      target_depth =0 + 2*1 -1 =1.

      target_depth >= da (1 >=1 → yes).

      target_depth <= depth_X (1 <=1 → yes).

      subtract =1 if K >= s (0 >=0) and K <= 2*s (0 <=0) → yes. subtract=1.

      k = target_depth - da =0.

      start = 2 <<0 =2.

      end=2+1-1=2.

      count = 1 <<0 =1 (since end=2 <=10).

      contribution = 1-1=0.

      ans +=0.

   Then current becomes 1.

   Processing current=1:

      da=1.bit_length()-1=0.

      s=1-0=1.

      target_depth=0+2*0 -1= -1.

      target_depth < da (0), so skip.

      contribution is 0.

   So ans is 0. But sample output is 1. Wait, this is incorrect.

   Wait, sample input 1's first test case is N=10, X=2, K=0. The answer is 1 (only X itself).

   So what's wrong with the algorithm?

   Let's re-examine the first test case.

   For K=0, the nodes at distance 0 from X=2 is only X itself.

   So the algorithm should count 1.

   But according to the algorithm:

   For current=2:

      target_depth =0 + 2*1 -1 =1.

      K=0, s=0.

      subtract is 1 if K >=s (0>=0) and K <=2*s (0 <=0) → yes.

      So subtract 1.

      count_in_subtree is 1 (nodes at depth 1 in subtree of 2. Subtree of 2 includes 2,4,5, etc. Depth 1 in subtree of 2 is depth 1 + 0 (k=0) → depth 1.

      So nodes at depth 1 in subtree of 2 is 2 itself. So count_in_subtree is 1.

      contribution is 1-1=0.

   Then processing current=1:

      target_depth=0 + 2*0 -1= -1 < da (0). So no contribution.

   So total ans is 0, but correct answer is 1.

   So the algorithm is missing the case where K=0. Because when K=0, the target_depth for A=X is K + 2*da - depth_X =0 + 2*1 -1=1. But the node X is at depth 1. So the algorithm is trying to find nodes in the subtree of X (which is just X) at depth 1. But X's depth is 1. So count_in_subtree is 1. Then subtract 1 if the node is on the path from X to A (which is X itself). So the contribution is 0.

   But the correct answer is 1. So the algorithm is not considering the case where K=0.

   Ah, I see the problem. The algorithm is considering all ancestors of X, including X itself. But when K=0, the distance is zero, which is only X. So how does this fit into the algorithm?

   Let's re-examine the formula.

   The distance between X and Y is K. For K=0, Y must be X.

   So in the algorithm, when processing A=X:

   target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X.

   da is depth(X) =1.

   So target_depth =0 + 2*1 -1 =1.

   So the algorithm is looking for nodes in the subtree of X (which is X itself) at depth 1. Which is X itself, since X's depth is 1. So count_in_subtree is 1.

   Then, subtract is 1 if K >= s (s=0) and K <= 2*s (0 <=0). So subtract is 1.

   So contribution is 1-1=0.

   But the correct answer is 1, which suggests that the algorithm is not capturing this case.

   So what's wrong here?

   The problem is that when K=0, the only node is X itself. But according to the algorithm, this node is being counted and then subtracted. So the algorithm is not considering that for K=0, the target_depth is the depth of X, and the node is on the path from X to A (X itself).

   So the algorithm's logic is flawed in this case.

   Let's think again: when K=0, the distance is zero. So Y must be X. So in the algorithm, this case should be captured when A=X, and target_depth = depth(X). So for A=X:

   target_depth =0 + 2*da - depth_X =0 + 2*depth_X - depth_X = depth_X.

   So target_depth = depth_X.

   So in this case, the nodes in the subtree of A=X at depth target_depth is 1 (X itself).

   subtract is 1 if K >= s (s=0) and K <= 2*s (0 <=0). So subtract=1.

   So contribution is 1-1=0.

   But this is wrong. The correct contribution should be 1-0=1, because the node X is not on the path from X to A=X. Wait, the path from X to A=X is just X itself. So the node X is on the path. So the algorithm subtracts 1, but in reality, the node X is the one we want to count. So the algorithm is subtracting it when it shouldn't.

   Ah, here's the problem. The algorithm subtracts the node on the path from X to A, but when A=X, the path is just X itself. So when K=0, the node X is the only one that should be counted, but the algorithm is subtracting it.

   So the logic for subtracting is incorrect. The subtract should be 1 only if the node on the path from X to A is in the subtree of A at target_depth, and is not X itself when K=0.

   Wait, no. The subtract is supposed to subtract the nodes that are on the path from X to A, which are not part of the subtree of A's children. But when A=X, the path from X to A is just X itself. So when target_depth is depth_X, the node is X itself. So in this case, the algorithm is subtracting 1, but X is the only node that should be counted for K=0.

   So the error is in the subtract logic. The subtract should be 1 only if the node on the path from X to A is not X itself. Or perhaps the subtract is for nodes that are on the path from X to A, but not A itself.

   Wait, the subtract is supposed to remove the nodes that are on the path from X to A, except for A=X. Because when A=X, the path is just X itself, and the node is exactly the one we want to count for K=0.

   So the subtract logic is incorrect. The subtract should be 1 only if the node on the path from X to A is not A itself. Because when A is X, the node on the path is X itself, which is the one we want to count for K=0.

   So how to adjust the subtract condition?

   The subtract should be 1 if the node on the path from X to A is not A itself. Because when A is X, the node is X itself, and we should not subtract it.

   So the subtract is 1 if the node on the path from X to A is in the subtree of A at target_depth, and is not A itself.

   So the condition for subtract is:

   (target_depth == depth of the node on the path from X to A) and (node is not A).

   Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think differently.

   The nodes on the path from X to A are X, parent(X), ..., A. For each of these nodes, their depth is depth_X, depth_X-1, ..., da.

   So for each A, the nodes on the path from X to A are s+1 nodes (where s = depth_X - da).

   The target_depth for this A is K + 2*da - depth_X.

   The node on the path from X to A that is at target_depth is the one at depth target_depth. This node is in the subtree of A if and only if target_depth >= da.

   So for each A, the subtract is 1 if:

   - target_depth is in the range [da, depth_X], and

   - the node on the path from X to A at target_depth is not A itself (i.e., the node is in the path from X to A but is not A).

   Wait, no. For example, when A is X, then the node on the path is X itself. So in this case, the node is A itself. So when A is X and K=0, target_depth = depth_X. So the node is X itself. We should not subtract it.

   So the subtract should be 1 only if the node on the path from X to A at target_depth is not A. Because when the node is A, it's the root of the subtree, and it's not part of the path that branches off from the path from X to A.

   Wait, this is getting very confusing. Let's try to find a general rule.

   The subtract is the number of nodes in the subtree of A at target_depth that are on the path from X to A.

   The path from X to A is a single path. So in the subtree of A, the nodes on the path from X to A are exactly the nodes from A to X (but X is in the subtree of A only if A is an ancestor of X).

   So for each A, the nodes on the path from X to A that are in the subtree of A are the nodes from A to X (including A and X).

   But wait, the subtree of A includes all descendants of A, including X. So the path from X to A is part of the subtree of A.

   So the nodes on the path from X to A in the subtree of A are the nodes from A to X (including both). So for each A, the nodes on the path from X to A in the subtree of A are the nodes from A to X.

   So for target_depth, the nodes in the subtree of A at target_depth that are on the path from X to A are the node at depth target_depth on the path from X to A, which is in the subtree of A.

   So for each A, there is exactly one such node if target_depth is in the range [da, depth_X].

   But when that node is A itself (i.e., target_depth == da), then it's the root of the subtree. So when we are considering the subtree of A, the node A is part of the subtree, and the nodes in the subtree of A at depth da is just A.

   So when processing A=X, target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X.

   For K=0, target_depth = 0 + 2*depth_X - depth_X = depth_X.

   So the node is X itself. So in this case, the subtract is 1, which is causing the algorithm to subtract 1 from the count_in_subtree (which is 1), leading to zero contribution. But this is incorrect.

   So the error is that when the node on the path from X to A is A itself (i.e., target_depth == da), then the node is part of the subtree of A, but it's the root. So in this case, the node is not part of any other subtree, and for K=0, this is the only node that should be counted.

   So the subtract should not be applied when the node on the path from X to A is A itself. Because when the node is A, it's the root of the subtree, and there's no other path. So the subtract should be 1 only if the node on the path from X to A is not A.

   So the condition for subtract is:

   (target_depth >= da) and (target_depth <= depth_X) and (target_depth > da)

   Because target_depth == da means the node is A itself.

   So subtract is 1 if:

   (target_depth >= da) and (target_depth <= depth_X) and (target_depth > da) → target_depth is in (da, depth_X]

   So the node is on the path from X to A and is not A itself.

   So the subtract condition is:

   if (target_depth > da) and (target_depth <= depth_X) and (K >= s and K <= 2*s):

       subtract =1

   else:

       subtract =0

   Wait, but K >= s and K <= 2*s is equivalent to target_depth >= da and target_depth <= depth_X.

   Because target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X.

   Let's see:

   K >= s → K >= depth_X - da → target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X >= (depth_X - da) + 2*da - depth_X = da.

   K <= 2*s → K <= 2*(depth_X - da) → target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X <= 2*(depth_X - da) + 2*da - depth_X = 2*depth_X - 2*da + 2*da - depth_X = depth_X.

   So target_depth is in [da, depth_X] if and only if K is in [s, 2*s].

   So the subtract is 1 if target_depth is in (da, depth_X] (i.e., target_depth > da and target_depth <= depth_X) and K is in [s, 2*s].

   But target_depth > da implies K > s.

   Because target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X = K - s + da.

   So target_depth > da → K - s + da > da → K - s >0 → K > s.

   So subtract is 1 if K is in (s, 2*s], and target_depth <= depth_X.

   So the condition for subtract is:

   (K > s) and (K <= 2*s) → subtract =1.

   Because target_depth > da implies K > s.

   So in the algorithm, subtract is 1 if (K > s) and (K <= 2*s).

   So for the first test case:

   A=X=2, da=1, s=0.

   K=0.

   subtract is 1 if (0>0) and (0 <=0) → false. So subtract=0.

   So contribution is count_in_subtree - subtract =1-0=1.

   So ans=1.

   Then processing A=1:

   da=0, s=1.

   target_depth=0+2*0 -1= -1 < da=0. So no contribution.

   So total ans is 1, which matches the sample.

   So the error in the previous algorithm was that subtract was being applied even when the node was A itself (target_depth == da). So the corrected subtract condition is subtract=1 only if (K > s) and (K <= 2*s).

   So the algorithm should be modified to:

   subtract = 1 if (K > s) and (K <= 2*s) else 0.

   Let's re-calculate the first test case with this correction.

   Test case 1: X=2, K=0.

   Processing A=2:

   da=1, s=0.

   target_depth=0 + 2*1 -1=1.

   K=0.

   subtract=1 if (0>0) and (0 <=0) → false. So subtract=0.

   count_in_subtree=1.

   contribution=1-0=1.

   ans=1.

   Processing A=1:

   target_depth=-1 < da=0. So no contribution.

   So total ans=1. Correct.

   Now let's check the second sample test case: K=1.

   Test case 2: N=10, X=2, K=1.

   Sample output is 3.

   Let's see.

   X=2, depth_X=1.

   Ancestors are 2 and 1.

   Processing A=2:

   da=1, s=0.

   target_depth=1 + 2*1 -1=2.

   K=1.

   subtract=1 if (1>0) and (1 <=0) → false. So subtract=0.

   k=2-1=1.

   start=2<<1=4.

   end=4+1-1=5.

   count=2^1=2 (since 5<=10).

   contribution=2-0=2.

   ans=2.

   Processing A=1:

   da=0, s=1.

   target_depth=1 + 2*0 -1=0.

   target_depth >= da (0>=0 → yes).

   subtract=1 if (1>1) and (1 <=2*1) → (1>1) is false. So subtract=0.

   k=0-0=0.

   start=1<<0=1.

   end=1+1-1=1.

   count=1 (since 1<=10).

   contribution=1-0=1.

   ans=2+1=3. Which matches the sample.

   So the corrected algorithm works for this case.

   Now, let's adjust the algorithm to use the new subtract condition.

   So the algorithm becomes:

   For each ancestor A of X:

      da = A.bit_length() -1

      s = depth_X - da

      target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X

      if target_depth < da:

          continue

      k = target_depth - da

      start = A << k

      if start > N:

          count =0

      else:

          end = start + (1 <<k) -1

          if end > N:

              count = N - start +1

          else:

              count = 1 <<k

      subtract = 1 if (K > s) and (K <= 2*s) else 0

      contribution = max(0, count - subtract)

      ans += contribution

   Now, let's test this with the first sample test case where K=0.

   For A=2:

   subtract is 1 if (0>0) and (0 <=0) → false. So subtract=0.

   contribution=1-0=1.

   For A=1:

   target_depth=0+0*2 -1= -1 <0. So no contribution.

   So ans=1. Correct.

   Now, let's see the case where K=0.

   The algorithm now correctly captures the X node.

   So the key correction is changing the subtract condition to (K > s) and (K <= 2*s).

   Now, we need to implement this in Python.

   Also, we need to handle large values of N, up to 1e18. Python can handle this as it supports big integers.

   Now, let's implement the algorithm.

   The steps for each test case:

   Read N, X, K.

   Compute depth_X = X.bit_length() -1.

   Initialize ans=0.

   Iterate over all ancestors of X (including X itself):

      current starts as X.

      while True:

          process current.

          if current is 1: break.

          current = current //2.

   For each current:

      da = current.bit_length() -1.

      s = depth_X - da.

      target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X.

      if target_depth < da: continue.

      k = target_depth - da.

      start = current << k.

      if start > N: count=0.

      else:

          end = start + (1 <<k) -1.

          if end > N: count = N - start +1.

          else: count = 1 <<k.

      subtract = 1 if (K > s) and (K <= 2*s) else 0.

      contribution = max(0, count - subtract).

      ans += contribution.

   So the code in Python would look like:

   import sys

   def main():
       import sys
       input = sys.stdin.read().split()
       idx = 0
       T = int(input[idx])
       idx +=1
       for _ in range(T):
           N = int(input[idx])
           X = int(input[idx+1])
           K = int(input[idx+2])
           idx +=3
           depth_X = X.bit_length() -1
           ans = 0
           current = X
           while True:
               da = current.bit_length() -1
               s = depth_X - da
               target_depth = K + 2*da - depth_X
               if target_depth >= da:
                   k = target_depth - da
                   start = current << k
                   if start > N:
                       count = 0
                   else:
                       end = start + (1 << k) -1
                       if end > N:
                           count = N - start +1
                       else:
                           count = 1 << k
                   # compute subtract
                   if K > s and K <= 2*s:
                       subtract = 1
                   else:
                       subtract = 0
                   contribution = max(0, count - subtract)
                   ans += contribution
               # move to parent
               if current == 1:
                   break
               current = current // 2
           print(ans)

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       main()

   Now, let's test this code against the sample input 1.

   Sample Input 1:

   5

   10 2 0 → output 1

   Let's see:

   X=2, depth_X=1.

   current=2:

      da=1.

      s=0.

      target_depth=0+2*1 -1=1.

      target_depth >=1 → yes.

      k=0.

      start=2<<0=2.

      end=2+1-1=2.

      count=1.

      subtract=1 if (0>0) and (0 <=0) → false. subtract=0.

      contribution=1.

      ans=1.

   current becomes 1.

   current=1:

      da=0.

      s=1.

      target_depth=0+0*2 -1= -1 <0 → no contribution.

   So ans=1. Correct.

   Second test case: K=1.

   X=2, K=1.

   current=2:

      da=1, s=0.

      target_depth=1+2*1 -1=2.

      k=1.

      start=2<<1=4.

      end=4+1-1=5.

      count=2.

      subtract=1 if (1>0) and (1 <=0) → false. subtract=0.

      contribution=2.

   current=1:

      da=0, s=1.

      target_depth=1+0*2 -1=0.

      k=0.

      start=1<<0=1.

      end=1.

      count=1.

      subtract=1 if (1>1) and (1 <=2) → false. subtract=0.

      contribution=1.

   ans=3. Correct.

   Third test case: K=2.

   Sample output is 4.

   Let's see:

   X=2, K=2.

   Processing current=2:

      da=1, s=0.

      target_depth=2 + 2*1 -1=3.

      da=1, target_depth=3 >=1 → yes.

      k=3-1=2.

      start=2<<2=8.

      end=8+3=11. But N=10.

      count=10-8+1=3.

      subtract=1 if (2>0) and (2 <=0) → false. subtract=0.

      contribution=3.

   current=1:

      da=0, s=1.

      target_depth=2 +0*2 -1=1.

      k=1-0=1.

      start=1<<1=2.

      end=2+1-1=2.

      count=1<<1=2 (since 2<=10).

      subtract=1 if (2>1) and (2 <=2*1 → 2<=2 → yes). So subtract=1.

      contribution=2-1=1.

      ans=3+1=4. Correct.

   Fourth test case: K=3.

   Sample output is 2.

   X=2, K=3.

   Processing current=2:

      target_depth=3+2*1 -1=4.

      da=1.

      k=4-1=3.

      start=2<<3=16 >10 → count=0.

      contribution=0.

   current=1:

      da=0, s=1.

      target_depth=3+0*2 -1=2.

      k=2-0=2.

      start=1<<2=4.

      end=4+3=7.

      count=4 (since 7<=10).

      subtract=1 if (3>1) and (3 <=2*1 → 3<=2 → no). subtract=0.

      contribution=4-0=4.

   Wait, but sample output is 2. So something is wrong.

   Wait, let's re-calculate:

   For current=1:

      target_depth=3+0*2 -1=2.

      da=0.

      s=1.

      K=3.

      subtract=1 if (3>1) and (3 <=2*1 → 3<=2 → no). So subtract=0.

      k=2-0=2.

      start=1<<2=4.

      end=4+3=7.

      count=4 (nodes 4,5,6,7).

      contribution=4-0=4.

      ans=0+4=4. But sample output is 2.

   Hmm, this suggests a mistake in the algorithm.

   Wait, sample input for K=3:

   The answer is 2 (nodes 6 and 7).

   So according to the algorithm, when processing current=1:

   target_depth=3+0*2 -1=2.

   da=0.

   s=1.

   K=3.

   subtract=1 if (3>1) and (3 <=2*1 → 3<=2 → no). So subtract=0.

   count_in_subtree is 4 (nodes 4,5,6,7).

   So contribution is 4-0=4.

   But according to the sample, the answer is 2.

   So the algorithm is overcounting.

   What's wrong here?

   Let's re-examine the case.

   For X=2, K=3.

   The nodes at distance 3 from X are 6 and 7.

   So the algorithm's calculation must be incorrect.

   Let's see:

   For each ancestor A of X:

   A=2:

      target_depth=3+2*1 -1=4.

      da=1.

      target_depth=4 >=1 → yes.

      k=4-1=3.

      start=2<<3=16 >10 → count=0.

      contribution 0.

   A=1:

      target_depth=3+0*2 -1=2.

      da=0.

      s=1.

      K=3.

      subtract=1 if (3>1) and (3 <=2 → no). subtract=0.

      k=2-0=2.

      start=1<<2=4.

      end=4+3=7.

      count=4 (nodes 4,5,6,7).

      contribution=4.

   So ans=4. But sample output is 2.

   So the algorithm is adding 4, but the correct answer is 2.

   So where is the mistake?

   The nodes 4,5,6,7 are at depth 2. But the distance from X=2 to these nodes:

   - distance to 4: 1 (path 2→4). So distance 1.

   - distance to 5: 1 (path 2→5). So distance 1.

   - distance to 6: path 2→3→6. Wait, no. Wait, the parent of 6 is 3. So the path from 2 to 6 is 2→1→3→6. That's 3 edges. So distance 3.

   Similarly, 7's path is 2→1→3→7. Distance 3.

   So nodes 6 and 7 are at distance 3 from X=2.

   Nodes 4 and 5 are at distance 1 from X=2.

   So the algorithm is incorrectly counting nodes 4 and 5 as part of the answer for K=3.

   So why is the algorithm counting them?

   Because when processing A=1, target_depth=2.

   The nodes in the subtree of A=1 at depth 2 are nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Wait, no. The subtree of A=1 is all nodes. The depth of a node is its distance from the root. So nodes at depth 2 in the subtree of A=1 are nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, etc., but for N=10, nodes 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 are at depth 2?

   Wait, no. The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root. So:

   node 1: depth 0.

   nodes 2,3: depth 1.

   nodes 4,5,6,7: depth 2.

   nodes 8,9,10: depth 3.

   So for target_depth=2, the nodes are 4,5,6,7.

   So when processing A=1, target_depth=2.

   The nodes in the subtree of A=1 at depth 2 are 4,5,6,7.

   The algorithm's code calculates count=4.

   subtract=0.

   So contribution=4.

   But the distance from X=2 to these nodes is:

   - 4: distance 1.

   -5: distance 1.

   -6: distance 3.

   -7: distance 3.

   So the algorithm is adding 4 nodes, but only 6 and 7 are valid. So why?

   Because the algorithm's formula is incorrect.

   The formula says that the distance is K if the target_depth is computed as K + 2*da - depth_X.

   For A=1, da=0, depth_X=1.

   target_depth=3 + 2*0 -1 =2.

   So the nodes in the subtree of A=1 at depth 2 are 4,5,6,7.

   The distance from X=2 to these nodes is:

   For node 4: distance is 1 (path 2→4).

   For node 5: distance is 1 (path 2→5).

   For node 6: distance is 3 (path 2→1→3→6).

   For node 7: distance is 3 (path 2→1→3→7).

   So the algorithm is considering these nodes as being at distance K=3. But only 6 and 7 are at distance 3.

   So the algorithm's formula is incorrect.

   So the error is in the formula for target_depth. The formula is not correctly capturing the distance.

   The formula for target_depth is derived from the distance equation:

   distance = depth(X) + depth(Y) - 2*depth(A).

   So for the distance to be K, we have:

   K = depth(X) + depth(Y) - 2*depth(A).

   Rearranged: depth(Y) = K + 2*depth(A) - depth(X).

   So target_depth is depth(Y) = K + 2*da - depth_X.

   So for A=1, da=0, target_depth=3+0*2 -1=2.

   So depth(Y)=2.

   So Y is at depth 2.

   The distance from X=2 to Y is K=3.

   So the equation says 3 = 1 + 2 - 2*0 → 3=3. So yes.

   But for Y=4, depth(Y)=2.

   distance from X=2 to Y=4 is 1.

   So according to the equation, 1 = 1 + 2 - 2*0 → 1=3. Which is incorrect.

   So the formula is incorrect.

   So the algorithm's approach is flawed.

   This indicates that the initial approach is incorrect, and the formula for target_depth is not correctly capturing the distance.

   So what's wrong with the formula?

   The formula assumes that the LCA of X and Y is A. But when Y is in the subtree of A, the LCA of X and Y is the LCA of X and Y, which may not be A.

   So the formula is only valid when A is the LCA of X and Y.

   So the algorithm's approach is to iterate over all possible LCA candidates A (ancestors of X), and for each A, compute the number of Y in the subtree of
