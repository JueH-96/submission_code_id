Okay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.

So, the problem is about moving hands on a ring of parts. The initial positions are left hand at 1, right at 2. Each operation allows moving one hand to an adjacent part, but the other hand can't be on the destination. Then, there are Q instructions where each instruction requires that after some operations, a specific hand (H_i) is on T_i. The other hand can be moved as needed. The goal is to find the minimal total operations to follow all instructions in order.

Hmm. The key is to model the state of the hands after each instruction and compute the minimal steps required for each transition.

Let me think about how to model the state. The state is determined by the positions of the left (L) and right (R) hands. But since the ring is circular, the positions wrap around. Also, the order of L and R might matter in terms of movement constraints.

Wait, the movement rules: when moving a hand, you can only move to an adjacent part, and the destination can't be occupied by the other hand. So, for example, if L is at position 1 and R is at 2, then L can't move to 2 (since R is there), but can move to 6 (assuming N=6) if that's adjacent. Wait, the ring structure: each part i is adjacent to i-1 and i+1 (mod N). So for N=6, part 1 is adjacent to 6 and 2.

So, in the initial state, L is at 1, R at 2. So L can move to 6 (since it's adjacent and R isn't there), but can't move to 2. Similarly, R can move to 3, but can't move to 1 (since L is there).

Each instruction requires that after moving, the specified hand is at T_i, but the other hand can be anywhere else (as long as it's not on the same position). So for each instruction, we need to transition from the current state (L_prev, R_prev) to a new state (L_new, R_new) where either H_i is L and L_new = T_i, or H_i is R and R_new = T_i. The other hand can be anywhere except the new position of H_i.

The challenge is to model the minimal steps required for each transition, and accumulate the total.

But how do we model the possible positions of the hands and compute the minimal steps between states?

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where the state is the positions of L and R, and for each instruction, we transition to a new state while accumulating the minimal steps.

But the problem is that N can be up to 3000, and Q up to 3000. So the number of possible states is O(N^2), which for N=3000 is 9 million. For Q=3000, the total operations would be 9e6 * 3e3 = 2.7e10, which is way too big. So a straightforward DP approach with O(N^2) states per step is not feasible.

Therefore, we need a smarter way to model the state transitions, perhaps by keeping track of certain properties rather than the exact positions.

Wait, let's think about the problem constraints. Each instruction only requires that the specified hand is at a certain position. The other hand can be anywhere else. So for each instruction, the other hand's position is flexible as long as it's not conflicting.

So maybe for each step, we can model the possible positions of the two hands in a way that captures the minimal steps needed, but without tracking every possible combination.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be computed based on the relative positions of the hands and the target positions.

Let me think about the movement. When moving from one state to another, the minimal steps would be determined by how the hands need to move. But since the hands can't be on the same position, their movement is constrained.

Wait, but during the process of moving, the hands can pass through positions as long as they don't end up on the same spot. So the movement is a path where each step moves one hand to an adjacent position, not occupied by the other.

But how to model the minimal steps between two states (L1, R1) and (L2, R2), given that during the movement, the hands can move in any order, but each step is a single hand moving.

Alternatively, perhaps for each instruction, the minimal steps can be computed based on the current positions of the hands and the target position for the specified hand.

Let's think step by step. Let's say after processing i-1 instructions, the hands are at positions (L_prev, R_prev). For the i-th instruction, which is (H_i, T_i), we need to move the H_i hand to T_i. The other hand can be moved as needed, but the final position of the other hand can be anywhere except T_i.

The question is: what is the minimal number of steps required to get from (L_prev, R_prev) to a state where H_i is at T_i, and the other hand is at some position not equal to T_i.

Moreover, after this instruction, the other hand's position can be chosen optimally to minimize the total steps.

So, for each instruction, the minimal steps would be the minimal steps required to move the H_i hand to T_i, considering that the other hand can be moved in a way that helps, but without conflicting.

Wait, but how?

Let's consider the first instruction in the sample input 1:

Sample Input 1:

6 3

R 4

L 5

R 5

Initial state: L=1, R=2.

First instruction: R must be at 4. So the right hand needs to move from 2 to 4. How?

The right hand can move to 3, then to 4. That's 2 steps. But during this movement, the left hand is at 1. So each step of the right hand is allowed as long as it's not moving into the left's position.

In this case, moving R from 2 →3 →4 is allowed. So 2 steps.

So after first instruction, R is at 4, L is at 1. But wait, the left hand could have moved as well. But in this case, moving the left hand isn't necessary.

But maybe moving the left hand can allow the right hand to move faster. Hmm.

Wait, but in the first instruction, the left hand is allowed to move as long as during each step, the movement is valid. So perhaps moving the left hand out of the way could allow the right hand to move more efficiently.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps for each instruction can be computed by considering the movement of the required hand to the target, and the other hand can be positioned in a way that minimizes the steps.

Wait, perhaps for each instruction, the minimal steps are the minimal steps required to move the H_i hand from its current position to T_i, considering that the other hand can be moved to avoid blocking.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to track the positions of the two hands after each instruction, but since the other hand's position can be optimized, we can track for each instruction the possible positions of the other hand that would allow minimal steps.

Wait, here's an idea. After each instruction, the required hand (H_i) is fixed at T_i. The other hand can be anywhere except T_i. So for the next instruction, the other hand's position is variable, but we can choose the best possible position (the one that allows minimal steps for the next instruction).

But how do we model this? Because for each instruction, after moving H_i to T_i, the other hand can be in any position except T_i, and we need to track the minimal steps to reach all possible positions of the other hand.

But that's again O(N) possibilities per instruction, which for Q=3000 would be O(N*Q) = 9e6 steps. That's manageable.

Wait, let's think. For each instruction, the state can be represented by the position of the other hand. Because the H_i hand is fixed at T_i. So after processing the i-th instruction, the H_i is at T_i, and the other hand (let's call it O_i) can be at some position not equal to T_i. For the next instruction, depending on whether it's L or R, the O_i may become the H_i of the next instruction.

Wait, perhaps the state after each instruction is the positions of both hands, but since one of them is fixed (the one specified by H_i), the other can be in any position except that. So for each instruction, the possible state is determined by the position of the other hand.

But how to model transitions between these states.

Alternatively, perhaps for each instruction, we can track the possible positions of the non-specified hand and the minimal steps required to reach each possible position.

Let me formalize this.

Suppose we have a current state where the left hand is at L_prev, and the right hand is at R_prev.

Now, the next instruction is (H_i, T_i). Let's say H_i is 'R'. So after this instruction, the right hand must be at T_i, and the left hand can be at any position except T_i.

The minimal steps required to move from (L_prev, R_prev) to (L_new, T_i), where L_new != T_i, and the sum of steps is minimized.

But how to compute the minimal steps between these two states.

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as, for each instruction, the required hand must move to T_i. The other hand can be moved in any way as long as it doesn't block the required hand's movement. So the minimal steps would be the steps needed for the required hand to reach T_i, plus the steps needed to move the other hand out of the way, but perhaps these can be done in parallel.

Wait, but movement is sequential. Each operation is moving one hand. So, for example, if the required hand needs to move through a position that's blocked by the other hand, the other hand must move first.

But this seems complicated. How can we model this efficiently?

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps for each instruction can be computed by considering the movement of the required hand to T_i, and the other hand can be positioned optimally to minimize the steps.

Let me think of the required hand's movement. The required hand (H_i) must move from its current position (current_H) to T_i. The minimal number of steps for this movement, ignoring the other hand, is the minimal steps on the ring. But since the other hand may block some paths, perhaps the required hand has to take a longer path if the direct path is blocked.

Wait, but the other hand can be moved out of the way. So perhaps the required hand's path can be adjusted by moving the other hand first.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the required hand's movement can be done in the minimal steps, and the other hand can be moved in such a way that it doesn't interfere. For example, if the other hand is in the way, we can move it out of the way once, allowing the required hand to pass.

But this is getting a bit vague. Maybe we need a mathematical model.

Let's model the problem for a single instruction. Suppose we have current positions (L, R). The instruction is to move H to T. Let's say H is R. So the new R must be at T, and L can be anywhere except T.

The minimal steps required are the steps to move R from R_prev to T, plus any steps needed to move L out of the way. But how?

Wait, during the movement of R to T, the L can be moved as needed. For example, if R needs to pass through a position that is currently occupied by L, then L must be moved first. But moving L takes some steps. So the total steps would be the steps for R to reach T, plus the steps for L to move out of the way, but perhaps these can be done in parallel.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal steps can be computed as the distance between R_prev and T (on the ring) plus the distance between L_prev and some position that allows R to move through. But this is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps for the required hand to reach T is the minimal steps on the ring (i.e., the minimal number of moves, which is min(|a - b|, N - |a - b|)), but adjusted for possible blockages by the other hand.

Wait, but the other hand can be moved. So if the other hand is in the way, we can move it once, allowing the required hand to proceed. So perhaps the minimal steps for the required hand is the minimal distance, and the steps for moving the other hand can be added if needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are the minimal distance for the required hand to reach T, plus the minimal steps needed to ensure that the other hand is not in the way during the movement.

But this seems difficult to model.

Let me think of an example. Suppose the current state is L=1, R=2. The instruction is R to 4. The minimal steps for R is 2 (2→3→4). Since L is at 1, which is adjacent to 2, but during the movement of R to 3, L is not in the way. So no problem. So steps are 2.

Another example: current state is L=3, R=4. Instruction is R to 1. The ring is N=6. The minimal steps for R to move from 4 to 1: the path could be 4→5→6→1 (3 steps) or 4→3→2→1 (3 steps). But L is at 3. So if R tries to move to 3, it's blocked. So R can't take the 4→3 path. So R must take the 4→5→6→1 path. So steps are 3. But during this movement, L is at 3. So R can't move through 3. So the minimal steps are 3.

But wait, maybe during the movement of R, we can move L out of the way. For example, first move L from 3 to 2 (1 step), then R can move from 4→3→2→1 (3 steps). But that would take 1+3=4 steps, which is worse than the 3 steps of the other path.

So in this case, moving L out of the way isn't beneficial. So the minimal steps are 3.

So the minimal steps for R to reach T is the minimal steps on the ring, considering that the path is blocked by L, but the blocked path may not be the minimal path.

Hmm, so perhaps the minimal steps for the required hand to reach T is the minimal steps on the ring, but if the other hand is in the way, then the required hand has to take the other path.

Wait, but how to compute that.

Alternatively, the minimal steps for the required hand to reach T is the minimal steps on the ring, and the other hand can be moved in such a way that it doesn't block the path.

But how to model that.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal steps for the required hand to reach T is the minimal steps on the ring, and the other hand can be moved to a position that's not on the path. So the steps for the other hand would be the minimal steps to move to a position that's not on the required hand's path.

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps for the required hand to reach T is the minimal steps on the ring, and the other hand can be moved to a position that's not in the way. So the steps required for the other hand are the minimal steps to move to a position that is not on the required hand's path.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps for each instruction, the minimal steps can be computed as the minimal steps for the required hand to reach T, plus the minimal steps required to move the other hand to a position that's not in the way. But how to determine when the other hand is in the way.

Wait, perhaps the other hand is in the way only if it's on the path that the required hand would take. So if the required hand's path is the minimal path, and the other hand is not on that path, then the steps are just the minimal steps. If the other hand is on that path, then the required hand has to take the longer path, which is N - minimal steps.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, let's think of the required hand's movement as a path. The other hand can be in a position that blocks the minimal path, but the required hand can take the other path, which is longer. Or, the other hand can be moved out of the way, which may take some steps, but allows the required hand to take the minimal path.

So the minimal steps would be the minimum between:

a) The required hand takes the minimal path, and the other hand is moved out of the way (if needed).

b) The required hand takes the longer path, and the other hand doesn't need to move.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, for each instruction, the minimal steps can be determined by the following steps:

1. Compute the minimal steps for the required hand to reach T, assuming the other hand is not blocking the path. Let this be 'd'.

2. Check if the other hand is in the minimal path. If not, then the steps are 'd'.

3. If the other hand is in the minimal path, then the required hand has to take the longer path (N - d), or the other hand can be moved out of the way, which may take some steps. So we need to choose the minimal between these options.

But how to determine if the other hand is in the minimal path.

Wait, the minimal path between current position and T is the clockwise or counter-clockwise direction, whichever is shorter. So the minimal steps are min(|a - b|, N - |a - b|).

The path is the sequence of positions from current to T in the direction that gives the minimal steps.

If the other hand is on that path, then moving the required hand along that path would require moving the other hand first.

But moving the other hand would take some steps. So the total steps would be the steps to move the other hand out of the path plus the steps for the required hand to move along the path.

Alternatively, maybe the required hand can take the longer path, which doesn't have the other hand in it. So the steps would be (N - d) steps for the required hand, and no steps for the other hand.

So the minimal steps would be the minimum between:

- (d + steps to move other hand out of the minimal path)

- (N - d)

But how to compute the steps to move the other hand out of the minimal path.

Alternatively, if the other hand is on the minimal path, then the required hand's path is blocked. So to use the minimal path, the other hand must be moved to a position not on the minimal path.

The minimal steps to move the other hand out of the path would be the minimal steps required for the other hand to move to a position adjacent to the path, but not on it.

Wait, but the other hand can move in any direction as long as it's not blocked by the required hand.

Alternatively, when the other hand is on the minimal path, the required hand can't move through it. So the other hand must be moved to a position outside the minimal path. The minimal steps to do that would be 1 (move to an adjacent position not on the path), but this depends on the current position.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be derived.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps for each instruction can be computed as the minimal steps for the required hand to reach T, plus the minimal steps required to move the other hand to a position that's not in the way. But how?

Wait, let's think of the other hand's position after the instruction. The other hand can be anywhere except T. So during the movement of the required hand to T, the other hand can be moved to any position except T. So perhaps the minimal steps are the steps required for the required hand to reach T, plus the steps required to move the other hand from its previous position to some position not in the way, but this movement can be done in parallel with the required hand's movement.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, since the other hand's movement can be done in any order, perhaps the minimal steps is the maximum of the steps required for the required hand and the steps required for the other hand to get out of the way.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think of another example. Suppose current state is L=2, R=3. Instruction is R to 5 (N=6). The minimal steps for R is 2 (3→4→5). The other hand is at 2, which is not on the path (3→4→5). So steps are 2.

Another example: current state is L=3, R=2. Instruction is R to 5. The minimal path for R is 2→3→4→5 (3 steps). But L is at 3. So R can't move to 3. So the minimal path is blocked. So R has to take the other path: 2→1→6→5 (3 steps). So steps are 3. So in this case, the minimal steps are 3.

But in this case, the other hand (L) is on the minimal path, so the required hand has to take the longer path.

So the minimal steps are the length of the longer path.

But how to compute this.

So perhaps the minimal steps for the required hand is the minimal between the two possible paths (clockwise and counter-clockwise), but if the other hand is blocking the minimal path, then the required hand has to take the longer path.

So the steps would be:

d_min = minimal steps (direction where the other hand is not in the path)

d_max = maximal steps (the other direction)

if the other hand is in the minimal path, then steps = d_max

else steps = d_min

But how to check if the other hand is in the minimal path.

Wait, the minimal path is a contiguous segment of the ring. For example, moving from current_pos to T in the clockwise direction, the minimal path is the positions from current_pos to T, inclusive, in the clockwise direction. If the other hand is in that segment, then it's blocking the path.

But how to check if the other hand is in that segment.

Alternatively, the minimal path can be determined by the direction. Let's say current_pos is a, T is b. The minimal steps are d = min(|a - b|, N - |a - b|). The direction is clockwise if |a - b| <= N/2, else counter-clockwise.

But the actual path is the positions from a to b in that direction.

So, for the minimal path, the other hand's position is in the interval [a, b] (if direction is clockwise) or [b, a] (if direction is counter-clockwise). But since it's a ring, the interval is circular.

Wait, perhaps the other hand's position is in the minimal path if moving in the minimal direction from a to T would pass through the other hand's position.

For example, if a is 2, T is 5, N=6. Minimal steps is 3 (2→3→4→5). The minimal path is 2,3,4,5. So if the other hand is at 3, it's in the path. If the other hand is at 6, it's not in the path.

So, to check if the other hand is in the minimal path:

Compute the minimal direction. Then check if the other hand's position is in the path from a to T in that direction.

But how to compute that.

Alternatively, the minimal path can be represented as the positions that are between a and T in the minimal direction. For example, in the clockwise direction, the positions are a, a+1, ..., T. Or in the counter-clockwise direction, a, a-1, ..., T.

But since it's a ring, the positions wrap around.

So, for the minimal direction, the other hand's position is in the path if:

If the direction is clockwise (d = (T - a) mod N <= N/2):

Then the other hand's position is in [a, T] (mod N).

If the direction is counter-clockwise (d = (a - T) mod N <= N/2):

Then the other hand's position is in [T, a] (mod N).

Wait, perhaps a better way to check is:

Let's compute the start (a) and end (b) of the minimal path. Then, for any position x, x is in the minimal path if moving from a to b in the minimal direction passes through x.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, for the minimal path, the positions are all the ones that are passed through when moving from a to b in the minimal direction.

So, for a and b, the minimal path is the set of positions from a to b in the direction that requires d steps.

So, for example, if a=2, b=5, d=3 steps (clockwise), the path is 2,3,4,5. So any x in {2,3,4,5} is in the path.

If a=5, b=2, d=3 steps (counter-clockwise), the path is 5,4,3,2. So x in {5,4,3,2}.

So, to check if the other hand's position (o) is in the minimal path, we can see whether o is between a and b in the minimal direction.

But how to compute that.

An alternative approach is:

If the minimal steps are d = (b - a) mod N (if this is <= N/2), then the minimal path is the positions from a to b in clockwise order. So, o is in the path if (o - a) mod N <= d.

Wait, no. For example, a=2, b=5, d=3. (o=3: (3-2) mod 6 =1 <=3 → yes. o=5: (5-2) mod 6=3 <=3 → yes. o=6: (6-2) mod6=4>3 → no.

But in this case, o=6 is not in the path.

So, the condition (o - a) mod N <= d would correctly capture whether o is in the path.

Similarly, if the minimal direction is counter-clockwise, then d = (a - b) mod N (if this is <= N/2). Then, the minimal path is from a to b in counter-clockwise direction, which is equivalent to (a - x) mod N <= d for x in the path.

Wait, maybe not. Let's see.

If a=5, b=2, d=3 (counter-clockwise). The path is 5→4→3→2. For x=4: (5 -4) mod6=1 <=3 → yes. x=3: (5-3) mod6=2 <=3 → yes. x=2: (5-2) mod6=3 <=3 → yes. x=1: (5-1) mod6=4>3 → no.

So the condition (a - x) mod N <= d would capture the path.

So, the general approach is:

Compute the minimal steps d and the direction.

If the direction is clockwise (i.e., moving from a to b in clockwise direction is minimal), then the other hand's position o is in the path if (o - a) mod N <= d.

If the direction is counter-clockwise, then o is in the path if (a - o) mod N <= d.

But wait, when direction is counter-clockwise, the minimal steps are d = (a - b) mod N (if that's <= N/2). So for example, a=5, b=2: (5-2) mod6=3, which is <=3 (since N=6, N/2=3). So direction is counter-clockwise.

In this case, the path is 5→4→3→2. For o=3: (5-3) mod6=2 <=3 → yes.

So the condition works.

So, given a current position of the required hand (a), target (b), and other hand's position (o), we can determine whether o is in the minimal path.

If o is in the minimal path, then the required hand cannot take that path. So the required hand must take the other path, which has length N - d.

But wait, if the required hand takes the other path, then the steps are N - d. But during that movement, the other hand may be in that path.

Wait, but the other path is the longer path. For example, in the case where the minimal path is 3 steps (clockwise), the other path is N - 3 steps. But if the other hand is in the minimal path, the required hand can take the longer path, which may or may not have the other hand in it.

But in the longer path, the other hand may not be present, so the required hand can move through it.

But how to check that.

Alternatively, perhaps when the other hand is in the minimal path, the required hand must take the longer path, and the steps are N - d. But during that movement, the other hand may be in the longer path. But since the longer path is N - d steps, which is larger than d, but the other hand may be in that path.

Wait, but the other hand is a single point. So in the longer path, the required hand moves through N - d steps, which is a longer path, but the other hand is in the minimal path. So the longer path may not include the other hand.

For example, in the case where a=5, b=2, minimal path is counter-clockwise (3 steps), and other hand is at 3 (which is in the minimal path). The longer path is clockwise, which is 3 steps (5→6→1→2). So the other hand is at 3, which is not in the longer path. So the required hand can take the longer path, which takes 3 steps.

So in this case, the steps are 3, which is the same as the minimal steps. But since the other hand is blocking the minimal path, the required hand has to take the longer path, which in this case is the same length. Wait, that's confusing.

Wait, no. The minimal steps are 3 (counter-clockwise), but the longer path is also 3 steps (clockwise). So in this case, the minimal steps and longer path are the same. So N must be even.

Ah, right. For N=6, the minimal steps and longer path can be the same when the distance is exactly N/2.

So in this case, the required hand can choose either path. But if the other hand is in one of the paths, the required hand can take the other path.

So the steps would be 3, regardless of the other hand's position.

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps for the required hand to reach T is the minimal steps (d) if the other hand is not in the minimal path, or the maximal steps (N - d) if the other hand is in the minimal path.

But how to compute this.

So, for each instruction, the steps for the required hand are:

if the other hand is in the minimal path:

    steps = N - d

else:

    steps = d

But how to compute whether the other hand is in the minimal path.

So, for each instruction, given the current positions (L_prev, R_prev), and the instruction (H_i, T_i):

1. Determine the current position of the required hand (current_H) and the other hand (current_O).

   For example, if H_i is 'R', then current_H is R_prev, and current_O is L_prev.

2. Compute the minimal steps (d) for the required hand to move from current_H to T_i.

   d = min( (T_i - current_H) % N, (current_H - T_i) % N )

   but actually, the minimal steps is the minimal between the clockwise and counter-clockwise distances.

   So, d = min( |T_i - current_H|, N - |T_i - current_H| )

3. Determine the direction of the minimal path. If |T_i - current_H| <= N/2, then the minimal path is clockwise (moving from current_H to T_i in increasing order). Otherwise, it's counter-clockwise.

   Wait, but when |T_i - current_H| is exactly N/2, the direction can be either.

4. Check if the other hand's current position (current_O) is in the minimal path.

   To do this, based on the direction:

   a. If the minimal path is clockwise (d = |T_i - current_H|):

      The minimal path includes all positions from current_H to T_i in clockwise order.

      So, current_O is in the minimal path if:

      (current_O - current_H) mod N <= d.

      But this is equivalent to current_O being between current_H and T_i in the clockwise direction.

   b. If the minimal path is counter-clockwise (d = N - |T_i - current_H|):

      The minimal path includes all positions from current_H to T_i in counter-clockwise order.

      So, current_O is in the minimal path if:

      (current_H - current_O) mod N <= d.

      Which is equivalent to current_O being between T_i and current_H in the counter-clockwise direction.

5. If the other hand is in the minimal path, then the required hand must take the longer path, which has steps N - d.

   Otherwise, the required hand can take the minimal path, with steps d.

But wait, in the example where the other hand is in the minimal path, but the longer path is also blocked by the other hand.

Wait, no. Because the longer path is the other direction. So if the other hand is in the minimal path, the longer path may or may not include the other hand.

But this approach assumes that the longer path does not include the other hand. But that's not necessarily true.

For example, N=6, current_H=2, T_i=5. Minimal path is 2→3→4→5 (d=3). The other hand is at 4 (in the minimal path). So the required hand must take the longer path (2→1→6→5, steps 3). But the other hand is at 4, which is not in the longer path. So steps are 3.

Another example: N=6, current_H=2, T_i=5. Other hand is at 6. The minimal path is 2→3→4→5 (steps 3). The other hand is at 6, which is not in the minimal path. So steps are 3.

Another example: current_H=3, T_i=1. N=6. Minimal path is 3→2→1 (steps 2). Other hand is at 2. So other hand is in the minimal path. So required hand must take the longer path (3→4→5→6→1, steps 4-2=4? Wait, no. The minimal steps for the longer path would be N - d = 6 - 2 =4 steps. So steps are 4.

But during that movement, the other hand is at 2, which is not in the longer path. So the required hand can move through the longer path without interference.

So the approach seems to work.

So, the steps for the required hand are:

steps_H = d if other hand is not in the minimal path, else N - d.

But then, what about the other hand's movement? Because during the steps_H steps, the other hand can be moved to any position, as long as it doesn't interfere with the required hand's movement.

Wait, but the other hand's movement can be done in parallel. For example, during each step, you can move either hand. So perhaps the other hand can be moved to a position that allows the required hand to take the minimal path, even if it was initially blocking.

But this would require moving the other hand first, which would take some steps.

So the minimal steps would be the minimal between:

a) Move the other hand out of the minimal path (steps_O) and then move the required hand through the minimal path (d steps). Total steps = steps_O + d.

b) Move the required hand through the longer path (N - d steps). Other hand can stay where it is. Total steps = N - d.

Choose the minimal of these two options.

But how to compute steps_O.

steps_O is the minimal steps required for the other hand to move from its current position to a position not in the minimal path.

But how to compute that.

The other hand's current position is in the minimal path. So steps_O is the minimal steps to move it to a position outside the minimal path.

The minimal steps would be 1, because the other hand can move to an adjacent position that's not in the minimal path.

Wait, for example, if the other hand is at position x, which is in the minimal path. Then, it can move to x-1 or x+1 (mod N). At least one of those positions is not in the minimal path.

Wait, the minimal path is a contiguous segment. So, if x is in the minimal path, then the adjacent positions may or may not be in the path.

For example, minimal path is 2→3→4→5. Other hand is at 3. Adjacent positions are 2 and 4. Both are in the path. So moving to 2 or 4 would not get out of the path. So the other hand needs to move further.

Wait, this complicates things. So steps_O could be more than 1.

So how to compute steps_O.

The minimal steps for the other hand to move out of the minimal path is the minimal number of steps required to reach a position outside the minimal path.

The minimal path is a contiguous segment of the ring. So the other hand is inside this segment. To get out, the other hand can move either clockwise or counter-clockwise, and the minimal steps would be the minimal distance to the nearest edge of the segment.

For example, the minimal path is from a to b in the clockwise direction. The other hand is at position x, which is in [a, b]. The edges are a and b. The minimal steps to exit the segment is min( (x - a) mod N, (b - x) mod N ) + 1.

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think.

If the minimal path is a contiguous segment from a to b (clockwise), then the other hand is at x, which is between a and b. To exit the segment, the other hand can move to a-1 (which is the same as b+1 mod N) or to b+1. The minimal steps would be the minimal steps to reach either edge and then step out.

For example, a=2, b=5 (N=6). x=3. The edges are 2 and 5. The steps to exit via 2 would be 3→2→1 (2 steps). Steps to exit via 5 would be 3→4→5→6 (3 steps). So minimal steps is 2.

But wait, the other hand can move to 2, but that's part of the minimal path. So it needs to move one step further. So from x=3, moving to 2 (step 1), then to 1 (step 2). Now, 1 is outside the minimal path.

So steps_O is 2.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, the minimal steps for the other hand to exit the minimal path is the minimal steps to reach a position outside the segment.

The segment is [a, b] in the clockwise direction.

The other hand's position x is in [a, b].

The minimal steps to exit is the minimal of:

(x - a) + 1 → move clockwise to a, then step out (to a-1 mod N).

OR

(b - x) +1 → move counter-clockwise to b, then step out (to b+1 mod N).

Wait, for example:

a=2, b=5. x=3.

(x - a) = 1 → steps to a is 1, then step out (to 1) → total 2 steps.

(b - x) = 2 → steps to b is 2, then step out (to 6) → total 3 steps.

So minimal steps is 2.

So steps_O = min( (x - a) + 1, (b - x) + 1 )

But since the segment is [a, b], which is a contiguous block in the clockwise direction, the length of the segment is d + 1 (since it includes both a and b, and the steps between them is d).

But when x is in the segment, the distance from x to a is (x - a) mod N, and to b is (b - x) mod N.

So steps_O is min( (x - a) + 1, (b - x) + 1 )

But how to compute a and b.

Wait, a is the starting position of the required hand (current_H), and b is the target position (T_i).

But in the case where the minimal path is clockwise, a is current_H, and b is T_i. The segment is [a, b], and the other hand is in this segment.

In the case where the minimal path is counter-clockwise, the segment is [T_i, current_H], and the other hand is in this segment.

So, steps_O is computed based on the segment.

So, for the minimal path being clockwise:

segment is [a, b]

other hand's position x is in [a, b]

steps_O = min( (x - a) + 1, (b - x) + 1 )

For minimal path being counter-clockwise:

segment is [b, a]

other hand's position x is in [b, a]

steps_O = min( (a - x) + 1, (x - b) + 1 )

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, steps_O is the minimal steps for the other hand to move out of the minimal path, which is 1 step if the other hand is at the edge of the segment, or more steps if it's inside.

But this seems complicated.

But perhaps, given the time constraints, we can model steps_O as 1 step.

Wait, but in the example where the other hand is at 3, in the minimal path [2,5], steps_O is 2 steps. So modeling it as 1 step would be incorrect.

So, this approach would not work.

Alternative Idea:

For each instruction, the minimal steps are:

steps_H = d if the other hand is not in the minimal path.

Else, steps_H = min( d + steps_O, N - d )

But steps_O is the minimal steps for the other hand to move out of the minimal path.

But how to compute steps_O.

Alternatively, steps_O is 1 step.

But this is not always the case.

Alternatively, steps_O can be computed as the minimal steps required for the other hand to move to a position not in the minimal path.

But how to compute that.

Let me think of the minimal path as a contiguous segment of the ring. The other hand is inside this segment. The minimal steps to exit the segment is the minimal distance to the nearest edge of the segment plus 1.

So for the minimal path [a, b] (clockwise), the other hand is at x. The nearest edge is either a or b.

The distance to a is (x - a) mod N.

The distance to b is (b - x) mod N.

The minimal distance to the edge is min( (x - a) mod N, (b - x) mod N )

Then, steps_O is minimal distance to edge + 1.

So steps_O = min( (x - a) mod N, (b - x) mod N ) + 1.

For example:

a=2, b=5, x=3.

(x - a) mod N = 1, (b -x) mod N = 2. Minimal is 1. steps_O = 1 + 1 = 2.

Which matches the example.

Another example: a=5, b=2 (counter-clockwise). The segment is [5, 2], which in the ring is 5, 4, 3, 2. The other hand is at 4.

The nearest edge is 5 (distance 1) or 2 (distance 3). So steps_O = 1 +1 = 2.

So the other hand moves to 5 → 6 (steps 2).

So steps_O is 2.

So, steps_O can be computed as described.

So, putting it all together:

For each instruction:

1. Determine current_H and current_O.

2. Compute d = minimal steps for current_H to reach T_i.

3. Determine if current_O is in the minimal path.

   a. Compute the direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise).

   b. Check if current_O is in the minimal path.

4. If current_O is not in the minimal path:

   steps += d.

   The other hand can stay where it is or move to any position, but the minimal steps is d.

   The new position of the other hand can be anywhere except T_i. So after moving, the other hand can be at any position except T_i. But to minimize future steps, we can choose the best possible position for the other hand. But how?

   Wait, after this instruction, the other hand's position can be chosen optimally. So for the next instruction, the other hand's position is not fixed. So perhaps, after each instruction, we can track the possible positions of the other hand and the minimal steps required to reach each possible position.

But this brings us back to the initial problem of state tracking.

But given that N and Q are up to 3e3, tracking for each instruction the possible positions of the other hand and the minimal steps to reach each is feasible.

So, here's the plan:

We'll model the state after each instruction as the position of the other hand (the one not specified by H_i). For each instruction, we need to track the minimal steps to reach each possible position of the other hand.

But how.

Let's see:

Initially, after instruction 0, the state is (L=1, R=2). So the other hand for the first instruction depends on what the first instruction is.

Wait, the initial state is L=1, R=2.

For each instruction, we need to track the current positions of L and R.

But this would be O(N^2) states, which is not feasible.

Alternative Idea:

After each instruction, the specified hand is fixed at T_i. The other hand can be in any position except T_i. For the next instruction, the specified hand may be the same or different.

So, after each instruction, the state is determined by the position of the other hand (the one not specified in the instruction).

So, for example, after processing an instruction where H_i is 'R', the new R is at T_i, and the L can be at any position except T_i. For the next instruction, if H_i is 'L', then the new L must be at T_i, and the R can be at any position except T_i.

So, the state after each instruction can be represented by the position of the non-specified hand.

Thus, for each instruction, we can track a map (dictionary) of possible positions of the other hand to the minimal steps required to reach that state.

This way, for each instruction, we can compute the new possible positions and the minimal steps.

Let's formalize this:

We'll maintain a dictionary (or array) that represents the minimal steps to have the other hand at position x after each instruction.

Initially, after instruction 0 (the initial state), the hands are at L=1, R=2.

So, for the first instruction, depending on whether it's L or R:

If the first instruction is H_1 = 'R', then the specified hand is R, which must move to T_1. The other hand is L. The initial position of L is 1. So for the first instruction, the other hand's initial position is 1.

But during the processing of the first instruction, the other hand (L) can be moved to any position except T_1.

So, after the first instruction, the possible positions of L are all positions except T_1, and for each possible position x, we track the minimal steps required to reach (R=T_1, L=x).

Then, for the next instruction, depending on H_2, the specified hand is either R or L. If H_2 is 'L', then the specified hand must move to T_2, and the other hand (R) can be in any position except T_2. The initial positions for this instruction are R=T_1 and L=x (from the previous state).

But how to model this.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem where for each instruction, we track the possible positions of the other hand and the minimal steps to reach each.

The steps would be:

Initialize the DP for the first instruction.

For each instruction i from 1 to Q:

   For each possible position of the other hand in the previous state:

      Compute the minimal steps to move the specified hand to T_i, considering the other hand's position.

      Update the DP for the current instruction's other hand positions.

But how to compute the steps.

Let's try to model this.

Let's denote that after processing instruction i-1, the specified hand is H_prev, which is at position T_{i-1}, and the other hand (O_prev) can be in any position except T_{i-1}.

The state is represented by the position of O_prev.

For instruction i, which is (H_i, T_i):

   If H_i is the same as H_prev:

      Then, the specified hand must move from T_{i-1} to T_i.

      The other hand is O_prev, which can be in any position except T_{i-1}.

      So, for each possible O_prev in the previous state, compute the steps required to move the specified hand from T_{i-1} to T_i, considering the other hand's position.

      The other hand can be moved during this process.

      After this instruction, the other hand is the O_prev's new position, which can be any position except T_i.

   Else:

      The specified hand is the other hand from the previous state.

      So, the previous specified hand (H_prev) is now the other hand, and must be moved to T_i.

      The other hand (O_prev) can be in any position except T_{i-1}.

      So, for each possible O_prev in the previous state, compute the steps required to move the new specified hand (H_prev) from O_prev to T_i, considering the other hand's position (T_{i-1}).

      After this instruction, the other hand is T_{i-1}, which can be moved during the process.

This seems quite complex, but perhaps manageable.

But how to compute the steps for each transition.

Let's take an example where the previous state is (H_prev, O_prev). For example, after instruction i-1, H_prev is 'R' and O_prev is x (L's position).

For instruction i, if H_i is 'R', then the specified hand is R, which must move from T_{i-1} to T_i. The other hand is L, which is at x (which is not T_{i-1}).

So, the current state is (R=T_{i-1}, L=x).

The instruction requires R to move to T_i. The other hand is L, which can be moved as needed, but after the instruction, L can be at any position except T_i.

So, the steps required to move R from T_{i-1} to T_i, given that L is at x, and during the movement, L can be moved to avoid blocking.

The minimal steps for this transition is computed as follows:

Compute the minimal steps for R to move from T_{i-1} to T_i, considering that L is at x.

But during this movement, L can be moved to any position except the new R's position.

But how to model this.

This brings us back to the earlier problem of computing the minimal steps for the required hand to move to T_i, given the other hand's position.

So, for each transition, the steps are computed based on the previous other hand's position.

Thus, the DP state can be represented by the other hand's position, and for each instruction, we compute the new DP state based on the previous state.

So, the algorithm would be:

Initialize the DP for the initial state.

For the initial state, after instruction 0 (the initial state), the hands are at L=1, R=2.

So, if the first instruction is H_1 = 'L', then the specified hand is L, which must move to T_1. The other hand is R, which is at 2.

So, the previous other hand's position is 2.

But for the first instruction, the initial state is (L=1, R=2). So the other hand's position is 2 if H_1 is 'L', or 1 if H_1 is 'R'.

So, for the first instruction, the previous other hand's position is known.

Then, for each instruction i:

   For each possible other hand's position in the previous state (x_prev):

      Compute the steps required to move the specified hand from its previous position (T_prev) to T_i, given that the other hand is at x_prev.

      Then, the new other hand's position can be any position except T_i. However, to minimize steps, we need to choose the best possible new other hand's position.

Wait, but during the movement of the specified hand to T_i, the other hand can be moved to any position except T_i, and the minimal steps is the sum of the steps required to move the specified hand and the steps required to move the other hand.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, during the movement of the specified hand to T_i, the other hand can be moved in any way that doesn't block the movement. The minimal steps is the steps required for the specified hand to reach T_i, plus the steps required to move the other hand to a position that allows the specified hand to move.

But this is again the same problem.

So, perhaps for each transition, the minimal steps can be computed as follows:

Let's denote:

current_H: the current position of the specified hand (T_prev)

current_O: the current position of the other hand (x_prev)

instruction: move H to T_i.

We need to compute the minimal steps to move H from current_H to T_i, considering that the other hand is at current_O.

The steps are computed as:

- Compute d = minimal steps for H to move from current_H to T_i.

- Check if current_O is in the minimal path.

   a. If not, steps_H = d. The other hand can stay at current_O (if it's not T_i), or can be moved to any other position except T_i. But moving the other hand would cost steps, but it's optional.

   b. If yes, steps_H = min( d + steps_O, N - d )

      where steps_O is the minimal steps for the other hand to move out of the minimal path.

But how to model steps_O.

Alternatively, the minimal steps for the other hand to move out of the minimal path is steps_O = 1 step. But this is not always correct.

Alternatively, steps_O is computed as the minimal steps required for the other hand to move to a position not in the minimal path.

But this requires knowing the minimal path and the other hand's current position.

So, for each transition, the steps are:

steps = steps_H + steps_O

where steps_H is the steps for the required hand to reach T_i, and steps_O is the steps for the other hand to move to a position not in the path.

But during the movement of the required hand, the other hand can be moved in parallel.

So the total steps would be the maximum of steps_H and steps_O.

Wait, because you can move the required hand and the other hand in parallel. So if steps_H is 3 and steps_O is 2, the total steps would be 3.

So, steps = max(steps_H, steps_O).

But this is only possible if the steps_O can be done in parallel with steps_H.

But how to model this.

This complicates the model further.

But perhaps this is the correct approach.

So, for each transition:

steps = max(steps_H, steps_O)

But steps_O is the minimal steps required for the other hand to move out of the way.

But how to compute steps_O.

Alternatively, the other hand can be moved to a position not in the minimal path in steps_O steps, and these steps can be done in parallel with the required hand's steps.

So the total steps is max(steps_H, steps_O).

But how to compute steps_O.

This seems like a promising approach.

So, the steps for the transition are:

if the other hand is not in the minimal path:

   steps_H = d

   steps_O = 0 (no need to move)

   total steps = steps_H

else:

   steps_H = N - d (required hand takes the longer path)

   steps_O = 0 (other hand doesn't need to move)

   or

   steps_H = d (required hand takes the minimal path)

   steps_O = steps_O (other hand moves out of the path)

   total steps = max(steps_H, steps_O)

   choose the minimal between the two options.

So, the minimal steps would be the minimal between:

max(d, steps_O) and (N - d)

So, steps = min( max(d, steps_O), N - d )

But how to compute steps_O.

As before, steps_O is the minimal steps required for the other hand to move out of the minimal path.

So, steps_O = minimal steps for other hand to exit the segment.

Which is computed as follows:

For the minimal path segment [a, b] (current_H to T_i in the minimal direction), the other hand is at x.

steps_O = min( (x - a) mod N, (b - x) mod N ) + 1.

So, steps_O is the minimal steps to exit the segment.

So, putting it all together:

For each transition:

current_H = previous position of the specified hand (T_prev)

current_O = previous position of the other hand (x_prev)

new_H = T_i

Compute d = minimal steps between current_H and new_H.

Compute whether current_O is in the minimal path.

If current_O is not in the minimal path:

   steps = d

   new_O can be any position except new_H. But to minimize future steps, we can choose new_O to be current_O (if it's not new_H), or any other position. But since the other hand can be moved for free (as long as it's not blocking), perhaps the optimal new_O is current_O (if it's not new_H), or some other position.

   Wait, but during the movement of the required hand, the other hand can be moved to any position except new_H. So after moving the required hand to new_H, the other hand can be at any position except new_H.

   So, the new_O can be chosen as any position except new_H, and the minimal steps would be steps = d.

   But how to track the new_O's position.

   This suggests that after the transition, the other hand can be at any position except new_H. But for the next instruction, the other hand's position will be tracked, and the minimal steps for each possible position will be considered.

   However, tracking all possible positions for the other hand is not feasible for large N.

   So, perhaps the optimal new_O's position is the one that allows the minimal steps for the next instruction.

   But this requires knowing the next instruction, which we don't have.

   Therefore, the best we can do is to track the minimal steps for each possible new_O position.

   But with N up to 3e3 and Q up to 3e3, this would be O(Q*N) time, which is manageable.

So, the DP approach is:

For each instruction, we track a dictionary (or array) of possible other hand positions and the minimal steps to reach each.

Initially, for the first instruction:

If H_1 is 'L', then the previous state is (L=1, R=2). The specified hand is L, which must move to T_1. The other hand is R at 2.

So, the previous other hand's position is 2.

We compute the steps to move L from 1 to T_1, considering that R is at 2.

Then, after moving L to T_1, the other hand (R) can be moved to any position except T_1.

So, for each possible new_O (R's position) not equal to T_1, we compute the minimal steps to reach that new_O.

But how.

Wait, during the movement of L to T_1, R can be moved as needed. So the steps required to move L to T_1 and R to new_O is the sum of the steps for L and the steps for R, but since they can be moved in parallel, the total steps is the maximum of the steps for L and the steps for R.

But this is only possible if the steps for L and R are independent.

But this is not necessarily the case, as moving R may block L's path.

So, this seems to require a more detailed analysis.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to model the DP as follows:

For each instruction, track the possible positions of the other hand and the minimal steps to reach each.

For each instruction i:

   For each possible other hand position x_prev in the previous state:

      Compute the steps required to move the specified hand from T_prev to T_i, given that the other hand is at x_prev.

      For this transition, the other hand can be moved to any position x_new != T_i.

      The steps required for this transition is the steps to move the specified hand to T_i plus the steps to move the other hand to x_new, but considering that they can be moved in parallel.

      So, the steps for the transition is max(steps_H, steps_O).

      steps_H is the steps required for the specified hand to move from T_prev to T_i, considering the other hand's initial position x_prev.

      steps_O is the steps required for the other hand to move from x_prev to x_new.

      But x_new can be chosen to minimize steps_O.

      However, x_new must not be T_i.

      So, for each x_prev, we can compute the minimal steps to transition to any x_new != T_i.

      But this would be O(N) for each x_prev, leading to O(N^2) per instruction, which is not feasible.

Alternative Idea:

For each transition, after moving the specified hand to T_i, the other hand can be moved to any position except T_i. The minimal steps to do this is the steps required to move the specified hand to T_i, plus the steps required to move the other hand from x_prev to x_new, but the other hand can be moved in parallel.

But since the other hand's movement is flexible, the minimal steps for the transition is the steps required for the specified hand to reach T_i, and during that time, the other hand can be moved to any position except T_i.

So, the steps for the transition is the steps required for the specified hand to reach T_i, and the other hand can be moved to any position except T_i in steps_O steps, where steps_O <= steps_H.

Thus, the total steps for the transition is steps_H.

But the other hand can be moved to any position except T_i during the steps_H steps.

So, after the transition, the other hand can be at any position except T_i, and the minimal steps to reach each x_new is steps_H.

But this is only possible if the other hand can be moved to x_new in steps_O steps, where steps_O <= steps_H.

So, for each x_new != T_i, the minimal steps to reach x_new is steps_H, provided that the distance between x_prev and x_new is <= steps_H.

But this may not be the case.

Alternatively, during the steps_H steps, the other hand can be moved as much as possible. So, the maximum distance the other hand can move is steps_H steps.

So, the other hand can move from x_prev to any position within steps_H steps. So, the new x_new can be any position that is within steps_H steps from x_prev, and not equal to T_i.

But this is not necessarily all positions.

This is getting very complicated.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem with dynamic programming, where for each instruction, we track the minimal steps to reach each possible position of the other hand.

For each instruction i, we have a DP array that tracks the minimal steps to have the other hand at position x after completing the i-th instruction.

Initially, for the first instruction, the other hand's position is known (either 1 or 2), and we compute the steps for each possible new other hand position.

For each subsequent instruction, we compute the new DP array based on the previous DP array.

Let's formalize this:

We'll use two arrays: prev_dp and curr_dp.

prev_dp[x] represents the minimal steps to have the other hand at position x after instruction i-1.

For instruction i:

   curr_dp is initialized to infinity for all positions.

   For each x_prev in prev_dp where prev_dp[x_prev] is not infinity:

      Compute the steps required to process the current instruction, given that the other hand is at x_prev.

      The specified hand's previous position is T_prev (the target of the previous instruction).

      The current instruction is (H_i, T_i).

      So, the specified hand must move from T_prev to T_i.

      The other hand is at x_prev.

      Compute the minimal steps for this transition, and for each possible new other hand position x_new (x_new != T_i), update curr_dp[x_new] with the minimal steps.

But how to compute the steps for the transition and the possible x_new.

This requires solving the problem of moving the specified hand from T_prev to T_i, given that the other hand is at x_prev, and during this movement, the other hand can be moved to any x_new != T_i.

The minimal steps for this transition is the minimal steps to move the specified hand to T_i, plus the steps to move the other hand to x_new, but allowing for parallel movement.

But this is equivalent to the maximum of the steps for the specified hand and the steps for the other hand.

So, steps = max(steps_H, steps_O).

But steps_O is the steps required to move the other hand from x_prev to x_new.

But x_new can be any position except T_i.

So, for each x_prev and x_new != T_i, steps = max(steps_H, steps_O), where steps_H is the steps required for the specified hand to move from T_prev to T_i given x_prev, and steps_O is the steps required for the other hand to move from x_prev to x_new.

But this is not feasible for large N.

Alternative Idea:

For each x_prev, compute the minimal steps to move the specified hand to T_i, and then for x_new, the other hand can be moved to any position except T_i in steps_O steps, which can be up to steps_H steps.

But the other hand can be moved to any position that is at most steps_H steps away from x_prev.

So, for x_new, the minimal steps_O is the minimal steps required to move from x_prev to x_new, which is the minimal distance between x_prev and x_new.

But since steps_O can be done in parallel with steps_H, the total steps is max(steps_H, steps_O).

But to minimize the total steps, we can choose x_new such that steps_O is as small as possible.

But how.

Alternatively, for a given x_prev, the steps_H is fixed. The other hand can be moved to any x_new != T_i, and the minimal steps for the transition is max(steps_H, steps_O).

To minimize this, for each x_prev, we can choose x_new such that steps_O is as small as possible.

The minimal steps_O is 0 (if x_prev is not T_i and we choose x_new = x_prev). But x_new can be x_prev only if x_prev != T_i.

So, for each x_prev:

if x_prev != T_i:

   steps_O can be 0, so the total steps is steps_H.

   So, x_new can be x_prev, and the steps is steps_H.

else:

   x_prev is T_i. So, the other hand must be moved to some x_new != T_i.

   steps_O is the minimal steps to move from T_i to x_new (x_new != T_i), which is 1 step.

   So, steps = max(steps_H, 1).

But this is only possible if the other hand can be moved during the steps_H steps.

So, the minimal steps for this case is max(steps_H, 1).

But how to compute steps_H.

So, the steps for the transition is:

if x_prev != T_i:

   steps = steps_H.

   x_new can be x_prev.

else:

   steps = max(steps_H, 1).

   x_new can be any position adjacent to T_i (since steps_O is 1).

But how to compute steps_H.

steps_H is the minimal steps required for the specified hand to move from T_prev to T_i, given that the other hand is at x_prev.

This brings us back to the earlier problem of computing steps_H based on the other hand's position.

So, steps_H is computed as:

if the other hand is in the minimal path:

   steps_H = min( d + steps_O_prev, N - d )

   where steps_O_prev is the steps required for the other hand to move out of the minimal path.

else:

   steps_H = d.

But this requires knowing whether the other hand is in the minimal path.

So, for each transition, steps_H is computed based on x_prev.

So, the algorithm for each transition is:

For each x_prev in prev_dp:

   current_H = T_prev

   current_O = x_prev

   new_H = T_i

   compute d = minimal steps between current_H and new_H.

   compute whether current_O is in the minimal path.

   if current_O is in the minimal path:

      steps_O_prev = minimal steps for current_O to exit the minimal path.

      steps_H = min( d + steps_O_prev, N - d )

   else:

      steps_H = d

   if new_H == H_i:

      # the specified hand is the same as previous, so the other hand is still the same.

      # after moving, the other hand can be any position except new_H.

      # but during the movement, the other hand can be moved.

      # So, for the new state, the other hand can be any x_new != new_H.

      # The steps required is steps_H.

      # So, for all x_new != new_H:

      # the steps to reach x_new is prev_dp[x_prev] + steps_H.

      # But since the other hand can be moved to x_new during the steps_H steps, the steps_O is the steps to move from x_prev to x_new.

      # So, the total steps for this transition is prev_dp[x_prev] + max(steps_H, steps_O).

      # But this is not feasible for large N.

      # So, we need to find the minimal steps for each x_new.

      # However, this is computationally expensive.

      # Alternative Idea: since during steps_H steps, the other hand can be moved anywhere, the minimal steps_O is the minimal steps to reach x_new from x_prev, which is min( |x_new - x_prev|, N - |x_new - x_prev| )

      # So, for each x_new != new_H, the steps is prev_dp[x_prev] + max(steps_H, steps_O).

      # But this would require O(N) operations per x_prev, which is O(N^2) per instruction.

      # This is not feasible for N=3e3.

      # So, we need a way to compute this efficiently.

      # Perhaps, the minimal steps for x_new is prev_dp[x_prev] + steps_H, if steps_O <= steps_H.

      # So, for x_new, the steps_O is the distance from x_prev to x_new.

      # If steps_O <= steps_H, then the total steps is prev_dp[x_prev] + steps_H.

      # Otherwise, it's prev_dp[x_prev] + steps_O.

      # But this is not necessarily correct.

      # Alternatively, the other hand can be moved to any x_new during the steps_H steps, so the steps_O is min( steps_H, steps_O ).

      # So, the steps for x_new is prev_dp[x_prev] + max( steps_H, steps_O )

      # But this is computationally expensive.

      # Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the other hand can be moved to any x_new != new_H in steps_H steps, so the steps for x_new is prev_dp[x_prev] + steps_H.

      # This would be the case if steps_O <= steps_H.

      # So, for all x_new != new_H, the steps is prev_dp[x_prev] + steps_H.

      # But this is only possible if the other hand can be moved to x_new in steps_H steps.

      # The minimal steps to move the other hand from x_prev to x_new is steps_O = min( |x_new - x_prev|, N - |x_new - x_prev| )

      # So, if steps_O <= steps_H, then the total steps is prev_dp[x_prev] + steps_H.

      # Else, it's prev_dp[x_prev] + steps_O.

      # But how to model this.

      # This seems impossible to compute efficiently.

      # So, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the other hand can be moved to any x_new != new_H, and the steps is prev_dp[x_prev] + steps_H.

      # This would be the case if steps_O <= steps_H.

      # So, for each x_prev, we can add steps_H to the previous steps, and for all x_new != new_H, set curr_dp[x_new] = min( curr_dp[x_new], prev_dp[x_prev] + steps_H )

      # This is O(N) per x_prev, but with N=3e3 and Q=3e3, this is O(3e3 * 3e3 * 3e3) = 2.7e10 operations, which is way too slow.

   else:

      # the specified hand is different from previous.

      # the new specified hand is the previous other hand.

      # So, the new specified hand must move from x_prev to T_i.

      # the other hand is the previous specified hand, which is at T_prev.

      # So, compute steps_H for the new specified hand to move from x_prev to T_i, given that the other hand is at T_prev.

      # Then, the new other hand is T_prev, which can be moved during the steps_H steps.

      # So, the new other hand can be any position except T_i.

      # So, similar to the previous case.

This suggests that the problem is quite complex and requires a different approach.

Alternative Idea:

The minimal steps for each instruction can be computed based on the current positions of the hands, and the other hand can be moved optimally to minimize steps.

But how to track the current positions.

Perhaps, after each instruction, the other hand can be positioned in a way that minimizes future steps.

But since the other hand's position is not fixed, we can track the best possible position for the other hand.

But what is the best possible position?

The best possible position for the other hand is the one that allows the next instruction to be processed with minimal steps.

But since we don't know the next instruction, the best we can do is to choose a position for the other hand that is as close as possible to the current position, or to the next instruction's target.

But this is not possible without knowing the next instruction.

Therefore, the optimal position for the other hand after each instruction is to be as close as possible to the current position of the specified hand, or in a position that allows flexibility.

But this is not clear.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem with dynamic programming, where for each instruction, we track the minimal steps for each possible position of the other hand.

But to compute this efficiently, we need to find a way to compute the transition steps for all possible x_prev and x_new in O(1) or O(N) time per instruction.

Let's try to proceed with this approach.

For each instruction i:

   Let the previous specified hand be H_prev, which is at position T_prev.

   Let the current instruction be (H_i, T_i).

   If H_i is the same as H_prev:

      The specified hand must move from T_prev to T_i.

      The other hand's previous position is x_prev (tracked in prev_dp).

      For each x_prev in prev_dp:

          compute steps_H as the minimal steps for the specified hand to move from T_prev to T_i, given that the other hand is at x_prev.

          For the new other hand's position x_new, which can be any position except T_i:

              steps_O = minimal steps for the other hand to move from x_prev to x_new.

              total_steps = prev_dp[x_prev] + max(steps_H, steps_O)

              curr_dp[x_new] = min(curr_dp[x_new], total_steps)

   Else:

      The specified hand is the previous other hand, which is at x_prev.

      The other hand is H_prev, which is at T_prev.
