<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.

So, the task is to replace each '?' in the given string S with A, B, or C such that the resulting string has at least K good substrings. We need to count the number of such possible replacements modulo 998244353.

First, I need to understand what a 'good string' is. A good string can be reduced to an empty string by performing the two operations any number of times. Operation 1 allows deleting two identical characters, and Operation 2 allows deleting one A, B, and C each.

Wait, but how do these operations work together? For example, the sample input 1's explanation shows that ABACA becomes AA after using Operation 2 on positions 2,4,5 (which are B, A, A?), but maybe I should think about the order of operations. Oh, but the key is that the entire string must be reducible to empty, regardless of the order of operations. So, perhaps the key is that the count of each character modulo certain numbers must be zero, or some invariant.

Wait, maybe there's a mathematical way to determine if a string is good. Let's think about the possible invariants. For example, each Operation 1 reduces the count of a character by 2. Operation 2 reduces each of A, B, C by 1. So, the total number of characters decreases by 2 or 3 each time.

But for the entire string to be reducible to empty, the sum of the counts must be possible to reach zero through these operations. Let's think about the parity and the total.

Letâ€™s denote the counts of A, B, C as a, b, c.

Each Operation 1 affects one of the counts by -2. Operation 2 reduces each by 1, so total -3.

The sum a + b + c must be reducible to zero. Let's see:

Each operation reduces the sum by 2 (for Operation 1) or 3 (for Operation 2). So the sum must be a multiple of 1 (since 2 and 3 are coprime? Wait, 2 and 3 have a GCD of 1. So any sum can be reduced to zero if possible through combinations of these operations. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, if the sum is 5, you could do 3 + 2. But maybe there's a condition on the counts.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that after all possible operations, the counts of each character must satisfy certain parity conditions.

Wait, let's think of the problem in terms of possible invariants. Let's see:

Suppose we have a, b, c. Let's see what operations can do.

Operation 1: reduces a by 2, or b by 2, or c by 2. So, the parity of a, b, c can change. For example, if a is even, it can be reduced to zero via operation 1. But operation 2 requires that all three are at least 1, and reduces each by 1. So, the parity of (a - b) mod 2, (a - c) mod 2, etc. Maybe some invariant exists here.

Alternatively, perhaps the necessary and sufficient conditions for a string to be good are:

- The sum a + b + c is zero (trivial, but that's the start).

Wait, but the sum starts as the length of the string. So, the sum must be reducible to zero via operations that subtract 2 or 3. So the sum must be a number that can be expressed as a combination of 2s and 3s. For example, sum 4 can be 2+2, sum 5 can be 3+2, sum 3 is 3, sum 2 is 2, sum 1 is impossible. So the sum must be at least 2 (unless it's zero) and not 1. Wait, but the original string is non-empty. So for a string to be good, the sum of its characters must be reducible to zero. So the sum (the length of the string) must be such that it can be reduced to zero by subtracting 2s and 3s. So the sum must not be 1. But wait, for example, a string of length 2 can be reduced if both characters are the same (operation 1). If they are different, then you can't apply operation 1 or 2. So the sum being 2 is okay if the two characters are the same, but not otherwise. So the sum being 2 is not sufficient. So this approach might not work.

Hmm, perhaps the key is that the entire string can be partitioned into pairs (for operation 1) and triplets (for operation 2). But how?

Alternatively, maybe the necessary and sufficient conditions for a string to be good are:

The total number of characters must be even or a multiple of 3? No, that's not the case. For example, the sample input 1's ABACA is length 5, which is not even or a multiple of 3, but it's a good string.

Wait, the sample input 1's ABACA becomes AA after operation 2 (which removes 3 characters), then operation 1 (removes 2), total 5-3-2=0. So sum 5 is possible.

So sum can be any number that can be reduced to zero via 2 and 3 steps. So sum must be >=2, but that's not sufficient. So perhaps the sum must not be 1, but even that's not sufficient.

So perhaps the key is not the sum but the individual counts. Let's think of the problem in terms of possible operations:

Each operation 2 reduces a, b, c each by 1. So the difference between the counts (a - b) mod 2, (a - c) mod 2, etc., could be important.

Wait, let's model the problem as a system of equations. Let's suppose that we perform x operations of type 2. Then, each operation 2 contributes to a reduction of 1 in a, 1 in b, 1 in c. Then, the remaining counts after x operations 2 would be a' = a - x, b' = b - x, c' = c - x. But these a', b', c' must be non-negative. Then, the remaining characters can be eliminated via operation 1, which requires that each a', b', c' is even (since you can delete pairs). So for the string to be good, there exists some x such that:

x <= min(a, b, c)

and

a - x is even,

b - x is even,

c - x is even.

Because after x operations of type 2, the remaining counts must all be even, so that they can be deleted via operation 1.

So the necessary and sufficient condition is that there exists an x (possibly zero) such that:

x <= min(a, b, c),

and (a - x) is even,

and (b - x) is even,

and (c - x) is even.

So, for a given a, b, c, we need to check if such an x exists.

Wait, let's test this with the sample input 1's example where the string is ABACA. The counts are A:3, B:1, C:1. So a=3, b=1, c=1.

We need to find x such that x <= min(3,1,1) = 1.

So x can be 0 or 1.

Check x=1:

a-x=2 (even), b-x=0 (even), c-x=0 (even). So yes. So x=1 is valid. So the string is good.

Another example: the substring AA (from sample input 1's explanation). a=2, b=0, c=0. So x can be 0. Then a-x=2 (even), but b-x=0 (even), c-x=0 (even). So yes. So AA is a good string.

Another example: AB (a=1, b=1, c=0). The min is 0. So x=0. Then a=1 (odd), b=1 (odd), c=0 (even). So no. So AB is not a good string. Because you can't apply any operations. So the string is not good.

So this condition seems to hold.

So the condition for a string to be good is that there exists x such that x <= min(a, b, c), and (a - x) is even, (b - x) is even, (c - x) is even.

So, given a substring, we can compute its a, b, c counts, and check this condition.

So the problem reduces to: for the entire string S after replacing the '?', count the number of substrings that are good (satisfy the above condition), and check if the total is >= K. We need to find how many replacements of '?' lead to the total count of good substrings >= K.

Now, the challenge is to compute this efficiently given that N is up to 50. Since N is small, but the number of possible replacements is 3^m where m is the number of '?'s. For m=50, that's 3^50 which is way too big. So we need a dynamic programming approach.

So, the plan is:

1. Precompute for all possible substrings (i, j) of the original string (after replacement), what is the count of a, b, c in that substring. But since the replacements are variables, we need to model the possible a, b, c counts for each substring, considering the possible choices of '?'.

But even that seems difficult. So perhaps, for each possible way to replace the '?', we can generate the entire string, then for each substring of that string, check if it's a good string, and count the total. If the total >= K, then increment the answer.

But with N=50, the number of possible replacements is 3^50, which is way too big. So this approach is impossible.

Thus, we need a smarter way. Let's think of dynamic programming where we track the state of the current position and some information about the possible a, b, c counts in the current substring.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering each possible substring (i, j) and precompute for each possible replacement pattern of the substring whether it is a good string, then use inclusion-exclusion to compute the total number of good substrings across the entire string for each possible replacement.

But even that seems challenging.

Wait, but the key is that each substring (i, j) can be considered independently in terms of whether it is a good string. However, the replacement choices affect multiple substrings. For example, replacing a single '?' in the original string affects all substrings that include that position.

But the problem requires us to count the number of replacement patterns where the sum over all substrings (i, j) of the indicator (substring is good) is >= K.

This is a counting problem where each replacement pattern contributes a sum of many indicators, and we need the sum to be >= K.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming, tracking for each position and some state related to the possible a, b, c counts in the current window, but given the size of N=50, this might be feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each possible substring (i, j) and for each possible way the characters in that substring are replaced (considering the fixed characters and the '?'), the number of ways that the substring is a good string. Then, the problem reduces to selecting a replacement pattern such that the sum over all (i, j) of the indicator (substring is good) is >= K. However, since the substrings are not independent (the replacement of a single '?' affects multiple substrings), this approach would not directly work.

Hmm, this is a tough problem. Let's think about the constraints again. N is up to 50, which suggests that a O(N^3) or O(N^4) approach might be feasible, but with some smart DP.

Let me think about the following approach:

For each possible replacement pattern, the total number of good substrings is the sum over all possible substrings (i, j) of 1 if the substring is good, else 0. We need the sum to be >= K.

We can model this using generating functions. For each position in the string, we can model the contribution of each possible replacement choice to the count of good substrings. However, the dependencies between substrings complicate this.

Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming to track, for each position, the possible state of the current window of characters that could form a substring ending at that position, and track how many good substrings are added by each possible replacement choice.

But this seems vague. Let's try to break it down.

Another angle: For each possible substring (i, j), compute the number of replacement patterns where the substring is good, and the rest of the string's replacements are arbitrary, but this leads to overcounting because different substrings may share '?'s, so their goodness is not independent.

But inclusion-exclusion is not feasible here. So perhaps the DP needs to track, for each position, the necessary information to compute the number of good substrings that end at that position.

Wait, here's an idea inspired by the problem of counting the number of substrings that are palindromes. In that problem, for each position, you expand around the center. But here, the condition for a substring being good is more complex.

Alternatively, for each possible start and end of a substring (i, j), we can precompute the possible a, b, c counts and the conditions for being a good string. But since the substring's characters depend on the replacement choices, which are variables, we need to model the possible a, b, c counts for the substring (i, j) given the original characters and the possible replacements.

But even this seems challenging. Let's consider that for a substring (i, j), the characters in positions i to j may include some fixed characters and some '?'. Each '?' can be replaced with A, B, or C. For the substring to be good, the a, b, c counts after replacement must satisfy the condition that there exists x such that x <= min(a, b, c) and (a -x) is even, (b -x) even, (c -x) even.

So for each substring (i, j), we can model the possible a, b, c counts as a multiset of possible values, considering the possible replacements of '?'. Then, for each such substring, the number of replacement patterns (for the entire string) that make this substring good is equal to the number of ways to replace the '?' in the substring such that the counts meet the condition, multiplied by 3^m, where m is the number of '?' outside the substring. However, this is only true if the '?' outside the substring are replaced freely, which is the case. But when considering multiple substrings, their replacement patterns are not independent. So this approach would not work for the entire problem, but perhaps for generating some part of the solution.

But the problem is to find the total number of replacement patterns where the sum of good substrings is >= K. So each replacement pattern contributes to the sum, and we need to count all patterns where their sum is >= K.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled with a DP that tracks, for each position in the string, the possible state of the current window and the cumulative count of good substrings so far. However, the state would need to track all possible combinations of a, b, c counts for all possible substrings ending at the current position, which is not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the DP state as the counts of a, b, c for the current substring starting at some position i, and track whether that substring is good. But even that might not be feasible for N=50.

Wait, but for each position j, the number of possible substrings ending at j is O(N). For each such substring (i, j), we can track the a, b, c counts and whether the substring is good. But since the counts can be up to j - i + 1, which is up to 50, the state space would be O(N^3 * 50^3), which might be manageable for N=50. Let's see:

For each j (current position), and for each possible i (start of substring), and for each possible a, b, c counts (each up to 50), track the number of ways to replace the characters in the substring (i, j) such that the counts are (a, b, c). Then, for each such state, determine if the counts satisfy the good string condition, and accumulate the total number of good substrings.

But this seems possible. Let's think in terms of dynamic programming.

The idea is to process each character in the string from left to right. For each position j, we can consider all possible substrings ending at j (i ranges from 1 to j). For each such substring (i, j), we track the possible a, b, c counts and the number of ways to replace the '?' in positions i to j to achieve those counts. Then, for each such substring, if the counts satisfy the good string condition, we add the number of ways to the total count of good substrings.

But the problem is that the replacement choices for the entire string must be consistent. For example, the same '?' in position k can be part of multiple substrings (i, j) where i <=k <=j. So the replacement of that '?' affects all such substrings. Therefore, the DP approach must model the entire string's replacement state, which is not feasible for N=50.

Ah, here's the crux of the problem. The replacement choices are global. Each '?' is replaced once, and that affects all substrings that include it. Therefore, the state of the DP must track the replacement choices made so far. But with N=50 and 3^50 possible states, this is impossible.

Therefore, the problem requires a different approach. Let's think of inclusion-exclusion or generating functions.

Alternative approach: For each possible replacement pattern, compute the number of good substrings it has. We need to sum over all replacement patterns where this number is >= K.

But how to compute this efficiently?

The key insight is that the number of good substrings can be computed as the sum over all possible substrings (i, j) of the indicator function (substring (i, j) is good). So the total is the sum of these indicators. We need the sum to be >= K.

The problem is equivalent to counting the number of replacement patterns where the sum of indicators is >= K. Each indicator depends on the replacement pattern's choices in the substring (i, j). Since the indicators are not independent, this is challenging.

But perhaps we can model this with a generating function where each possible replacement pattern contributes x^{sum of indicators}, and we need the sum of coefficients for x^k where k >= K.

However, generating functions for this problem would require tracking the sum of indicators, which can be up to N*(N+1)/2 (each substring can contribute 1). For N=50, this sum can be up to 1275. So the generating function would have exponents up to 1275, which is manageable. But the problem is to compute the coefficients for each possible sum, and then sum the coefficients for sums >= K.

But how to compute this generating function?

The generating function can be built by considering each position in the string and the possible choices for that position, and how each choice affects the sum of indicators. However, the choice for a position affects all substrings that include it, which complicates the transitions.

Alternatively, we can model the problem with dynamic programming, where the state includes the current position and the current count of good substrings, along with some information about the current state of the string that allows us to compute the new good substrings added by the current character.

But the issue is that adding a new character can create new substrings ending at that position, and each of these substrings may or may not be good. The state would need to track enough information to determine, for each possible substring ending at the current position, whether it is good. However, this requires tracking the a, b, c counts for all possible substrings ending at the current position, which is O(N^2) states for each position. For N=50, this would be 50^2 = 2500 possible substrings per position, each with their own a, b, c counts. But the counts can be up to 50, so the state space would be 50^2 * (50)^3 = 50^5, which is 312,500,000 states. This is way too big for a DP approach.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: For each possible substring (i, j), precompute the number of replacement patterns where the substring is good, and the rest of the string's '?'s are replaced arbitrarily. Then, the total number of replacement patterns where the sum of good substrings is >= K is equal to the sum over all subsets of substrings that include at least K substrings, multiplied by the number of ways to replace the '?'s not covered by those substrings. But this is incorrect because the events of different substrings being good are not independent. For example, two overlapping substrings may share some '?'s, so their goodness is not independent.

Therefore, inclusion-exclusion is not applicable here.

Hmm. This seems like a dead end. Let's think again about the problem constraints. N is up to 50, which suggests that perhaps a bitmask approach or some other O(2^N) approach is feasible, but 2^50 is way too big.

Wait, but perhaps the number of '?'s is small. But the problem allows up to N=50 '?'s. So that's not helpful.

Another idea: Since each replacement pattern is a sequence of choices for the '?'s, and each choice affects the a, b, c counts of all substrings that include that '?', perhaps the problem can be modeled with a DP that tracks, for each position, the possible a, b, c counts for all possible substrings ending at that position. But again, the state space is too large.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering that a substring (i, j) is good if and only if the counts a, b, c of the substring after replacement satisfy the condition. So for each substring (i, j), the number of replacement patterns that make it good is equal to the number of ways to replace the '?'s in (i, j) such that the counts meet the condition, multiplied by 3^{m - k}, where m is the total number of '?'s in the entire string, and k is the number of '?'s in the substring (i, j). But this is only true if the '?'s outside the substring are replaced freely. However, when considering multiple substrings, their replacement patterns are not independent. So this approach can't be used to compute the total sum.

But perhaps, if we can compute for each substring (i, j) the number of replacement patterns that make it good, and then use inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of patterns where at least K substrings are good. However, this is not possible because the events are not independent, and overlapping substrings may share '?'s, leading to overlapping events.

So, this approach is not feasible.

Hmm, perhaps the problem requires a different perspective. Let's think about the fact that each '?' can be replaced with A, B, or C. For each '?', we can model the choice as a variable. The key is to model the sum over all possible variables (choices for '?') such that the total number of good substrings is >= K.

But how to model this sum.

Another idea: The sum of indicators for each substring is a function of the variables (the choices for the '?'). We need to compute the sum over all assignments of variables where this function's value is >= K.

This is similar to a #SAT problem, where the variables are the '?'s, and the constraints are that the sum of indicators is >= K. But #SAT is generally hard, but perhaps the structure of the problem allows a dynamic programming approach.

Let's try to model this with dynamic programming. The state would track the current position, the current counts of a, b, c in all possible substrings ending at the current position, and the total number of good substrings so far. But this is impossible due to the high dimensionality of the state.

Alternatively, perhaps for each position j, and for each possible state of the last few characters (up to j), track the necessary information to determine the new good substrings introduced by adding this character. For example, for each j, track all possible substrings ending at j (i from 1 to j), and for each such substring, track the a, b, c counts. Then, for each possible replacement of the current character (if it's a '?'), update these counts and determine if the substring is good.

But even this approach would require O(N^2 * (N)^3) states, which is not feasible for N=50.

Wait, but perhaps the counts for a substring (i, j) can be represented as a triple (a, b, c). For each j, and for each possible i <= j, the triple (a, b, c) can be updated based on the previous state. For example, when processing j, the substring (i, j) is the substring (i, j-1) plus the j-th character. So for each i, the triple (a, b, c) can be computed incrementally.

But even so, for each j, there are j possible i's, each with a triple (a, b, c). For j=50, this is 50*50=2500 possible triples (since each a, b, c can be up to 50). But for each j, we need to track all possible i's and their triples.

Moreover, for each j, the current character may be fixed or a '?'. If it's a '?', we need to consider all three possible choices and their contributions.

But how does this help in tracking the total number of good substrings?

The key is that for each j, when we process the j-th character, we can compute all new substrings ending at j (i ranges from 1 to j), and for each such substring, determine if it's a good string. The total number of good substrings is the sum of all such determinants.

So, for each j, and for each possible replacement choice of the j-th character (if it's a '?'), we can compute the contribution to the total count of good substrings. But since the replacement choice affects all substrings ending at j, we need to model this in the DP.

So, the DP state can be:

dp[j][k][...] = the number of ways to replace the first j characters such that the total number of good substrings so far is k, and ... (some other information needed to compute the new substrings ending at j+1).

But the problem is that the '...' would need to capture the a, b, c counts for all possible substrings ending at j. This is not feasible.

Alternative idea: For the purpose of computing the number of good substrings, each substring (i, j) can be considered in isolation. However, the replacement choices for the entire string affect all substrings. So, the total number of good substrings is the sum over all (i, j) of an indicator function. We need to compute the sum over all replacement patterns where this sum >= K.

But how to model this sum in the DP.

Another possible approach is to use the linearity of expectation, but we're not asked for expectation but for the count. However, perhaps we can model the DP by accumulating the sum of good substrings as we build the string.

The DP state would be:

dp[pos][sum][...] = number of ways to replace the first pos characters such that the sum of good substrings so far is sum, and ... represents some state needed to compute the new good substrings added by the next character.

The key is to find a way to represent the state ... such that we can compute the new sum when adding a new character.

The new character can create new substrings ending at pos+1. For each possible substring (i, pos+1), we need to determine if it's a good string. To compute this, we need the a, b, c counts for the substring (i, pos+1). These counts can be built incrementally based on the previous counts for (i, pos).

So, for each position pos, and for each possible starting index i, we can track the a, b, c counts for the substring (i, pos). Then, when we add a new character at pos+1, for each i, we can update the counts for (i, pos+1) by adding the new character's contribution. Then, check if the new counts satisfy the good string condition. If so, add 1 to the sum.

But tracking all possible i and their counts for each pos is O(N^2 * (N)^3) states, which is not feasible.

But perhaps we can find a way to compress the state.

Wait, for a substring (i, j), the counts a, b, c are the number of A's, B's, and C's in the substring. When we add a new character at j+1, the counts for (i, j+1) are a + (new character is A?), etc. So for each i, the counts can be updated in O(1) time.

But if the current character is a '?', we need to consider all three possibilities. So, for each i, and for each possible replacement choice (A, B, C) for the current character, we need to update the counts and check the condition.

So, the DP state would need to track, for each possible i (starting position of the substring ending at the current position), the counts a, b, c for that substring. But this is O(N^2) states per position, which is 50*50=2500 per position, and for each of these, track the possible counts.

But the counts can be up to 50, so each a, b, c can be up to 50. So for each i, the state is (a, b, c), which has 50^3 possibilities. For N=50, this leads to 50 * 50^3 = 50^4 = 6,250,000 possible states per position, which is manageable for N=50.

But wait, for each position j, we need to track for each possible starting position i (from 1 to j), the counts a, b, c for the substring (i, j). So for j=50, this is 50 substrings, each with 50^3 possible counts. So for each j, the state is 50 * 50^3 = 6,250,000. For 50 positions, this would be 312,500,000 states, which is way too large.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: For each position j, and for each possible starting position i, track the counts a, b, c modulo 2 and the current x (the number of operation 2's) modulo something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the condition for a substring to be good is that there exists an x such that x <= min(a, b, c), and (a -x) is even, (b -x) is even, (c -x) is even.

Letâ€™s rearrange this condition. Let x be the number of operation 2's. Then, after x operations 2, the remaining counts are a' = a - x, b' = b -x, c' = c -x. These must be even and non-negative.

So, the conditions are:

x <= min(a, b, c)

a' = a -x >=0, even

b' = b -x >=0, even

c' = c -x >=0, even

So, x must be such that x is <= min(a, b, c), and a -x is even, and b -x is even, and c -x is even.

Letâ€™s find the parity of x. For a -x to be even, x must have the same parity as a. Similarly, x must have the same parity as b and c. So, for x to satisfy all three, a, b, c must have the same parity. Otherwise, no such x exists.

Wait, let's see:

x must be even if a is even, and odd if a is odd. Similarly for b and c. So, a, b, c must all have the same parity. Otherwise, there is no x that satisfies the parity conditions.

So, the first condition is that a, b, c are all even or all odd. If they are not, then no x exists.

If they are all even or all odd, then x must be equal to a mod 2, and also <= min(a, b, c).

So, the possible x is the maximum possible x that is <= min(a, b, c) and x â‰¡ a mod 2.

Wait, but x can be any value that satisfies x <= min(a, b, c) and x â‰¡ a mod 2, but the maximum x is the minimum of a, b, c, and if that has the same parity as a, then x is that minimum. Otherwise, x is min(a, b, c) - 1.

Wait, for example, a=3, b=1, c=1. min is 1. a is odd. x must be odd. So x=1 is allowed. Then, a-x=2 (even), b-x=0 (even), c-x=0 (even). So yes.

Another example: a=2, b=2, c=3. min is 2. a is even. x must be even. So x=2. Then, a-x=0 (even), b-x=0, c-x=1 (odd). So this doesn't work. So no x exists. Wait, but in this case, a, b, c are not all even or odd. So the first condition is not met.

So, the first step is to check if a, b, c are all even or all odd. If not, then no x exists. Otherwise, x must be the maximum possible value <= min(a, b, c) with the same parity as a.

Wait, but even if a, b, c are all even or odd, x may not exist. For example, a=2, b=2, c=2. x can be 0, 1, or 2. Let's see x=2: a-x=0, even. So yes. So the substring is good.

Another example: a=1, b=1, c=1. x can be 1. Then, a-x=0, etc. So yes.

But what about a=3, b=3, c=1. min is 1. a is odd. x=1. Then, a-x=2 (even), b-x=2 (even), c-x=0 (even). So yes.

So, the necessary and sufficient conditions are:

1. a, b, c are all even or all odd.

2. The maximum possible x (<= min(a, b, c) and with the same parity as a) allows a-x, b-x, c-x to be >=0 and even.

But since x is chosen as the maximum possible, and the parity is correct, the conditions a-x, b-x, c-x >=0 are automatically satisfied because x <= min(a, b, c).

Wait, because x <= min(a, b, c) implies that a-x >=0, b-x >=0, c-x >=0.

So, the conditions are:

- a, b, c are all even or all odd.

- The maximum x (<= min(a, b, c) and with the same parity as a) exists. But since x is at least 0 (if min(a, b, c) is >=0 and parity matches), this is possible.

Wait, for example, if a, b, c are all even, then x can be any even number up to min(a, b, c). But we need to choose x such that after x operations 2, the remaining counts are even. But x can be any even number up to min(a, b, c), but the maximum x is the largest even number <= min(a, b, c). Because choosing the maximum x reduces the remaining counts as much as possible, but any x that satisfies the parity and <= min(a, b, c) would work. Wait, no. Because after x operations 2, the remaining counts are a' = a -x, which must be even. But x can be any value that has the same parity as a. So, for example, if a is even, x can be even, and a' = even - even = even. Similarly for odd.

So, the existence of x is guaranteed if a, b, c are all even or all odd. Because x can be chosen as the maximum possible with the same parity as a, which is <= min(a, b, c). For example:

If a, b, c are all even:

x_max = min(a, b, c) if it's even, else min(a, b, c) - 1.

But wait, min(a, b, c) may be even or odd. But since a, b, c are all even, min(a, b, c) is even. So x_max = min(a, b, c). Then, a' = a - x_max, which is even - even = even. Similarly for b' and c'.

If a, b, c are all odd:

x_max = min(a, b, c) if it's odd, else min(a, b, c) - 1. But since a, b, c are all odd, min is odd. So x_max = min(a, b, c). Then, a' = a - x_max = even, and same for b' and c'.

So, in this case, the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for a substring to be good is that the counts a, b, c are all even or all odd.

Wait, this is a crucial insight! Because if a, b, c are all even or all odd, then there exists an x (as described) that allows the remaining counts to be even, and thus the substring is good. Otherwise, it's not.

So the condition for a substring to be good is that the counts of A, B, and C in the substring are all even or all odd.

This simplifies the problem significantly. Now, for a substring to be good, we just need to check if the counts of A, B, and C are all even or all odd.

So, the problem reduces to replacing the '?'s such that the number of substrings (i, j) where the counts of A, B, C are all even or all odd is at least K.

This is a much simpler condition to check. Now, the challenge is to model this efficiently.

So, for each substring (i, j), after replacing the '?'s, the counts of A, B, C in the substring must be all even or all odd. We need to count the number of replacement patterns where the sum of such substrings is >= K.

Now, how to model this.

Let's think about the parity of the counts. For each position in the string, the parity of the counts of A, B, C up to that position can be tracked. This is similar to a prefix sum approach.

Letâ€™s denote for each position j, the parity of the counts of A, B, C up to j. For example, for each j, we can compute a bitmask where the first bit is the parity of the number of A's up to j, the second bit for B's, and the third bit for C's. This is a 3-bit mask, which has 8 possible values.

For a substring (i, j), the parity of the counts of A, B, C in the substring is equal to the XOR of the prefix parities at i-1 and j. So, if the prefix parity at i-1 is (a1, b1, c1), and at j it's (a2, b2, c2), then the parity of the substring is (a1 ^ a2, b1 ^ b2, c1 ^ b2). For the substring to be good, this parity must be (0, 0, 0) (all even) or (1, 1, 1) (all odd).

So, the condition for the substring (i, j) to be good is that the prefix parity at i-1 and j are the same (all even) or all bits are flipped (all odd). So, the parity mask at i-1 and j must be equal or complementary.

Wait, let's see:

The parity of the substring (i, j) is (a_p(j) - a_p(i-1)) mod 2, similarly for B and C. So, the parity of the substring is (a_p(j) ^ a_p(i-1), b_p(j) ^ b_p(i-1), c_p(j) ^ c_p(i-1)).

For this to be all even, the XOR must be (0, 0, 0), which means that a_p(j) == a_p(i-1), b_p(j) == b_p(i-1), c_p(j) == c_p(i-1).

For this to be all odd, the XOR must be (1, 1, 1), which means that a_p(j) != a_p(i-1), b_p(j) != b_p(i-1), c_p(j) != c_p(i-1).

So, the condition is that the prefix parity at i-1 and j are either equal or complementary (all bits flipped).

So, for each pair of positions (i-1, j), the substring (i, j) is good if the prefix parity at i-1 and j are either the same or complementary.

This is a key insight. Now, the problem reduces to counting the number of replacement patterns where the number of pairs (i-1, j) with i <= j, such that the prefix parity at i-1 and j are the same or complementary, is at least K.

Now, the prefix parity depends on the replacement choices for the '?'s. Each '?' can be replaced with A, B, or C, which affects the prefix parity.

So, the plan is:

1. For each position j, track the possible prefix parity masks (3 bits) and the number of ways to achieve each mask up to j.

2. For each j, when processing the j-th character, update the prefix parity mask based on the current character (if it's fixed) or all possible choices (if it's a '?').

3. For each j, and for each possible prefix parity mask at j, compute how many new good substrings are added by this j. These are the substrings ending at j, i.e., (i, j) for i from 1 to j. For each such substring, check if the prefix parity at i-1 and j are the same or complementary. The number of such i's is the number of times a prefix parity mask m exists in the prefix up to j-1 such that m == current_mask or m == current_mask ^ 0b111.

4. Use dynamic programming to track the number of ways to reach each prefix parity mask at each position, along with the total number of good substrings accumulated so far.

This seems feasible. Let's elaborate.

The DP state can be:

dp[j][mask][k] = the number of ways to replace the first j characters such that the prefix parity mask after j characters is 'mask', and the total number of good substrings so far is k.

For each j, the prefix parity mask can be one of 8 possibilities. The total number of good substrings can be up to j*(j+1)/2, which for j=50 is 1275. So for each j, the DP state has 8 * 1275 possible states.

For each j, we process each possible state (mask_prev, k_prev) from j-1, and for each possible replacement choice of the j-th character (if it's a '?'), compute the new mask and the new k.

The transition steps are as follows:

For each j from 0 to N-1:

- For each possible previous mask_prev in dp[j][mask_prev][k_prev]:

   - For each possible current character c (A, B, C) if S[j] is '?', else just S[j]:

      - Compute the new_mask = mask_prev ^ delta(c), where delta(c) is the parity change for each character. For example, delta('A') is (1, 0, 0), delta('B') is (0, 1, 0), delta('C') is (0, 0, 1).

      - Compute the number of new good substrings added by this character. These are the number of times a prefix mask m exists in the prefix up to j, such that m == new_mask or m == new_mask ^ 0b111. This count is the number of occurrences of m in the prefix up to j-1 (i.e., in the previous DP states) that satisfy the condition.

      - So, for each occurrence of m in the previous DP states (mask_prev) where m == new_mask or m == new_mask ^ 0b111, the current character contributes 1 to the total k.

Wait, but how to track the number of times each mask has been seen up to j-1. For each j, when processing the j-th character, the new good substrings added are those where the current j is the end of the substring. For each such substring (i, j), the prefix parity at i-1 is m, and the current prefix parity is new_mask. So, the condition is m == new_mask or m == new_mask ^ 0b111.

Thus, the number of such substrings is the number of times m has been seen in the prefix up to j-1 (i.e., in positions 0 to j-1) that satisfy m == new_mask or m == new_mask ^ 0b111.

But how to track this efficiently.

Ah, here's the key: for each j, when processing the j-th character, the number of new good substrings added by this character is equal to the number of times the new_mask and new_mask ^ 0b111 have been seen in the prefix up to j-1.

So, for each j, and for each possible new_mask, the number of new good substrings added is the count of new_mask in the previous DP states (mask_prev) plus the count of new_mask ^ 0b111 in the previous DP states.

But how to track the counts of each mask_prev.

Wait, the DP state for j-1 includes all possible masks_prev and the number of ways to reach them, along with the accumulated k_prev. But for each new character choice, the new_mask is computed, and the number of new good substrings added is the sum over all mask_prev in the previous state where mask_prev == new_mask or mask_prev == new_mask ^ 0b111. For each such mask_prev, the number of ways is the count of that mask_prev in the previous DP state, and each such way contributes 1 to the k_prev.

But this seems like a lot to track. However, for each j, when we process the j-th character, we can precompute for each possible new_mask the number of times it and its complement have been seen in the previous DP state.

So, for the transition:

For each possible previous mask_prev and k_prev, and for each possible choice of c (if j-th character is '?'):

   new_mask = mask_prev ^ delta(c)

   current contribution to k is the number of mask_prev in the previous state that are equal to new_mask or new_mask ^ 0b111.

Wait, no. The new_mask is computed as mask_prev ^ delta(c). But the previous mask_prev is the mask up to j-1. So, the new_mask is the mask up to j. The new good substrings added are those where the substring starts at i, and the prefix i-1 has a mask that is either new_mask or new_mask ^ 0b111.

Wait, no. For the substring (i, j), the prefix i-1 has a mask m, and the current mask is new_mask. So, the condition is m == new_mask (so the substring's parity is all even) or m == new_mask ^ 0b111 (so the substring's parity is all odd).

Thus, for each new_mask, the number of such m in the previous masks (up to j-1) is the count of m == new_mask or m == new_mask ^ 0b111.

But how to track the count of each mask in the previous state.

Ah, for each j, the previous state (j-1) has a DP table where for each mask_prev, we have a count of ways to reach mask_prev with a certain k_prev. But when processing the j-th character, for each possible new_mask, the number of new good substrings added is the sum over all mask_prev in the previous state where mask_prev == new_mask or mask_prev == new_mask ^ 0b111. For each such mask_prev, the number of ways is the sum of the counts for those mask_prev in the previous state.

But this sum is the total number of ways that, for the j-th character's choice, the new_mask is such that the previous mask_prev satisfies the condition. For each such way, the k increases by the number of such mask_prev.

Wait, but for each way to reach mask_prev in the previous state, when we choose a character that leads to new_mask, the number of new good substrings added is the number of mask_prev that satisfy the condition. But this is not per way, but per new_mask.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think of it this way:

When processing the j-th character, for each possible choice of character c (A, B, C if it's a '?'), we compute the new_mask. Then, the number of new good substrings added by this choice is the number of times a mask_prev in the previous state (j-1) satisfies mask_prev == new_mask or mask_prev == new_mask ^ 0b111. For each such mask_prev, each way to reach mask_prev contributes 1 to the new good substrings.

So, for each new_mask, the number of new good substrings added is the sum of the counts of mask_prev and mask_prev ^ 0b111 in the previous state.

But how to compute this sum for each new_mask.

Ah, for each new_mask, the sum is the count of new_mask in the previous state plus the count of new_mask ^ 0b111 in the previous state.

But the previous state is the state after j-1 characters. So, for each new_mask, the number of new good substrings added is the sum of the counts of those two masks in the previous state.

But the counts in the previous state are the sum over all k_prev of the DP[j-1][mask_prev][k_prev], for each mask_prev.

Wait, but the DP[j-1][mask_prev][k_prev] represents the number of ways to reach mask_prev with a total of k_prev good substrings. So, the total number of ways to have mask_prev in the previous state is the sum over all k_prev of DP[j-1][mask_prev][k_prev].

So, for each new_mask, the number of new good substrings added is:

sum_prev = (number of ways to have new_mask in previous state) + (number of ways to have new_mask ^ 0b111 in previous state)

Each way to reach new_mask in the previous state contributes 1 to the new good substrings for this j-th character's choice.

So, for each choice of c, the new_mask is computed. Then, sum_prev is computed as the sum of the counts of new_mask and new_mask ^ 0b111 in the previous state.

Then, the new k is k_prev + sum_prev.

But how to track this in the DP.

The DP transition would be:

For each j from 0 to N-1:

   For each mask_prev in 0..7:

      For each k_prev in 0..current_max_k:

          count = dp[j][mask_prev][k_prev]

          if count == 0: continue

          For each possible c in allowed choices for S[j]:

              delta_mask = delta(c)

              new_mask = mask_prev ^ delta_mask

              sum_prev = (number of ways to have new_mask in previous state) + (number of ways to have new_mask ^ 0b111 in previous state)

              new_k = k_prev + sum_prev

              dp[j+1][new_mask][new_k] += count * (number of choices for c)

But this is not correct, because sum_prev is computed based on the previous state, not the current mask_prev.

Wait, no. For each j-th character, when processing a way to reach mask_prev in the previous state, the choice of c leads to new_mask, and the sum_prev is the sum of the counts of new_mask and new_mask ^ 0b111 in the previous state. But this sum_prev is the same for all ways that choose this c and new_mask.

But how to compute sum_prev for each new_mask.

Ah, sum_prev is the total number of ways in the previous state that have mask_prev equal to new_mask or new_mask ^ 0b111. So, for each new_mask, sum_prev is:

sum_prev = prev_count[new_mask] + prev_count[new_mask ^ 0b111]

where prev_count[m] is the total number of ways to have mask m in the previous state (sum over all k_prev of dp[j][m][k_prev]).

So, for each j, before processing the j-th character, we can precompute the prev_count for each mask.

This suggests that the DP can be optimized by tracking, for each j and mask, the total number of ways to reach that mask, regardless of the accumulated k. But this is not possible because the accumulated k is needed to determine whether the total is >= K.

So, this approach may not work directly.

Alternative Idea:

We can split the DP into two parts:

1. For each j, track the total number of ways to reach each mask, and the sum of k for those ways.

But this might not be sufficient.

Alternatively, we can model the DP as follows:

For each j, and mask, track a frequency array where freq[mask][k] is the number of ways to reach mask with exactly k good substrings.

Then, when processing the j-th character, for each possible previous mask_prev and k_prev, and for each possible choice of c:

   new_mask = mask_prev ^ delta(c)

   sum_prev = prev_count[new_mask] + prev_count[new_mask ^ 0b111]

   new_k = k_prev + sum_prev

   dp[j+1][new_mask][new_k] += dp[j][mask_prev][k_prev] * (number of choices for c)

But sum_prev is the sum of the counts of new_mask and new_mask ^ 0b111 in the previous state. However, sum_prev is computed based on the previous state's mask_prev, not the current new_mask.

Wait, no. sum_prev is the number of times a mask_prev in the previous state (j) satisfies mask_prev == new_mask or mask_prev == new_mask ^ 0b111. But new_mask is mask_prev ^ delta(c), so this depends on the current choice of c and the previous mask_prev.

This seems like a circular dependency, making it difficult to compute.

Hmm, this suggests that the initial approach may not be feasible, and we need to find a different way to model the problem.

Let me think again. The key insight is that the number of good substrings added by the j-th character is the number of previous masks (up to j-1) that are equal to the new_mask or its complement. For each j, this number depends on the new_mask and the previous masks.

So, for each j, and for each possible new_mask, the number of new good substrings added is the count of previous masks that are new_mask or new_mask ^ 0b111. This count is the same for all ways that lead to new_mask in the current step.

But how to track this in the DP.

Another Idea:

For each j, and for each mask, track the total number of ways to reach that mask, and the total number of good substrings accumulated so far. But also, track the count of each mask in the current DP state.

Wait, perhaps the DP can be split into two parts:

- For each j, a mask frequency table (mask_count[j][mask]) which tracks the number of ways to reach mask after j characters.

- For each j, a k frequency table (k_count[j][k]) which tracks the number of ways to have accumulated k good substrings after j characters.

But these two are not independent. The k_count depends on the mask_count and the transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of new good substrings added when processing the j-th character is independent of the previous k_prev, and depends only on the previous mask_count.

But this is not the case. For example, two different ways to reach the same mask_prev may have different k_prev values, but when processing the j-th character, they contribute the same new_k = k_prev + sum_prev.

So, the k_prev is additive, which makes it difficult to separate the mask and k tracking.

This suggests that the initial approach of tracking mask and k in the DP state is necessary.

But with N=50 and K up to 1275, and 8 masks, the total number of states is 50 * 8 * 1275 = 51,000. For each state, transitions are manageable.

So, let's proceed with this approach.

The steps are:

Initialize the DP with dp[0][0][0] = 1 (after 0 characters, mask is 0, and 0 good substrings).

For each j from 0 to N-1:

   For each mask_prev in 0..7:

      For each k_prev in 0..current_max_k:

          if dp[j][mask_prev][k_prev] == 0: continue

          Determine the possible choices for the j-th character.

          For each possible choice c (A, B, C if S[j] is '?', else just S[j]):

              delta_mask = delta(c)

              new_mask = mask_prev ^ delta_mask

              Compute the number of new good substrings added by this choice:

                  sum_prev = number of ways in the previous state (j) where the mask is new_mask or new_mask ^ 0b111.

                  This sum_prev is computed as:

                      sum_prev = mask_count_j[new_mask] + mask_count_j[new_mask ^ 0b111]

                  where mask_count_j is the sum over all k_prev of dp[j][m][k_prev] for m = new_mask and m = new_mask ^ 0b111.

              new_k = k_prev + sum_prev

              If new_k > K: cap it at K to avoid unnecessary computations (since we only need the sum >= K).

              dp[j+1][new_mask][new_k] += dp[j][mask_prev][k_prev] * (number of choices for c)

   After processing all j, compute the mask_count_j+1 for the next step.

But how to compute sum_prev for each new_mask.

Wait, sum_prev is the number of ways in the previous state (j) that have mask_prev equal to new_mask or new_mask ^ 0b111. So, for each new_mask, sum_prev is the sum of the counts of new_mask and new_mask ^ 0b111 in the previous state.

But the counts in the previous state are the sum over all k_prev of dp[j][new_mask][k_prev] and dp[j][new_mask ^ 0b111][k_prev].

So, for each j, we can precompute a mask_count array where mask_count[m] is the sum over all k_prev of dp[j][m][k_prev]. This can be computed for each j before processing the transitions.

So, the steps would be:

For each j from 0 to N-1:

   Precompute mask_count for j:

      mask_count = [0] * 8

      for m in 0..7:

          mask_count[m] = sum(dp[j][m][k] for k in all possible k)

   For each mask_prev in 0..7:

      For each k_prev in 0..current_max_k:

          if dp[j][mask_prev][k_prev] == 0: continue

          For each possible choice c:

              delta_mask = delta(c)

              new_mask = mask_prev ^ delta_mask

              sum_prev = mask_count[new_mask] + mask_count[new_mask ^ 0b111]

              new_k = k_prev + sum_prev

              # To avoid overflow, cap new_k at K if possible

              if new_k > K:

                  new_k = K  # since any state with k >= K will be counted in the final answer

              # Update the next state

              dp[j+1][new_mask][new_k] += dp[j][mask_prev][k_prev] * (number of choices for c)

              # Apply modulo 998244353

              dp[j+1][new_mask][new_k] %= MOD

This approach should work. The key is to precompute the mask_count for each j, which allows us to compute sum_prev efficiently for each new_mask.

Now, the delta(c) function:

For a character c, delta(c) is a 3-bit mask where each bit represents the parity change for A, B, C.

For example:

- c = 'A': delta = 0b100 (the A parity flips, B and C remain)
- c = 'B': delta = 0b010
- c = 'C': delta = 0b001

But wait, the mask is a 3-bit number where the first bit is the parity of the number of A's, the second for B's, and the third for C's. So, when you add a character, the parity for that character flips.

So, for example, adding an 'A' toggles the A parity bit. So, delta(c) is:

delta('A') = 0b100

delta('B') = 0b010

delta('C') = 0b001

So, the new_mask is mask_prev ^ delta(c).

Now, for the initial state, dp[0][0][0] = 1. This represents that after 0 characters, the mask is 0 (all counts even), and 0 good substrings.

For each j, the transitions are processed as described.

Finally, after processing all N characters, the answer is the sum of dp[N][mask][k] for all mask and k >= K.

But since K can be up to 1275, and N is 50, we need to track k up to K. However, to optimize, we can cap k at K, as any state with k >= K will contribute to the answer. So, during the transitions, if new_k exceeds K, we can set it to K to avoid unnecessary storage.

This is a common optimization in knapsack-like problems.

So, the final steps are:

- Initialize the DP table with dp[0][0][0] = 1.

- For each j from 0 to N-1:

   - Precompute mask_count for j.

   - For each mask_prev, k_prev:

      - For each possible c:

         - Compute new_mask and sum_prev.

         - Compute new_k as min(k_prev + sum_prev, K).

         - Update dp[j+1][new_mask][new_k] accordingly.

- The answer is the sum of all dp[N][mask][k] for k >= K.

Now, let's test this approach against the sample input 1.

Sample Input 1:

4 2

A?AB

The sample output is 1.

Let's see:

The possible replacements are:

Replace '?' with A: AAAB

Replace '?' with B: ABAB

Replace '?' with C: ACAB

For AAAB:

The good substrings are the two AA's. So total 2.

For ABAB:

The good substring is the entire ABAB. Let's check:

The counts are 2 A, 2 B, 0 C. All even. So yes.

So 1 good substring.

For ACAB:

The good substring is CAB. Counts 1 A, 1 B, 1 C. All odd. So yes. So 1 good substring.

So only the first replacement (AAAB) has >= 2 good substrings. So the answer is 1.

Now, let's see how the DP would process this.

The initial string is A?AB.

Processing j=0 (character 'A'):

mask_prev is 0, k_prev is 0.

The character is 'A', so delta is 0b100. new_mask = 0 ^ 0b100 = 0b100.

sum_prev is mask_count[j=0][new_mask (0b100)] + mask_count[j=0][new_mask ^ 0b111 (0b100 ^ 0b111 = 0b011)].

mask_count[j=0] is [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (only mask 0 has count 1).

sum_prev = 0 + 0 = 0.

new_k = 0 + 0 = 0.

So, after j=0, the new_mask is 0b100, and k=0.

dp[1][0b100][0] += 1.

Processing j=1 (character '?'):

For each possible choice (A, B, C).

For each choice, compute new_mask and sum_prev.

But let's proceed step by step.

At j=1, the previous state is j=0 with mask=0b100, k=0.

For each choice:

Case 1: choose A.

delta is 0b100. new_mask = 0b100 ^ 0b100 = 0b000.

sum_prev is mask_count[j=1][0b000] + mask_count[j=1][0b111].

But mask_count[j=1] is precomputed as the sum over all k_prev of dp[1][m][k_prev].

Wait, j=1 is being processed now. Wait, j=0 is the first character. j=1 is the second character (the '?'). So, during j=1's processing, the previous state is j=0.

So, for j=1, the previous state is j=0.

mask_count for j=0 is [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

So, for choice A:

new_mask = 0b100 ^ 0b100 = 0b000.

sum_prev = mask_count[j=0][0b000] + mask_count[j=0][0b000 ^ 0b111] = 1 + 0 = 1.

new_k = 0 + 1 = 1.

So, this contributes to dp[1+1=2][0b000][1] += 1 (number of ways) * 1 (number of choices for this case).

But wait, the '?' can be replaced with A, B, or C, each of which is a separate choice. So, for each choice, the contribution is 1 way, but multiplied by 1 (since the choice is one of three).

Wait, no. The '?' can be replaced with three options, so for each of the three choices, the contribution is 1/3 of the ways. But no, the DP counts the number of ways. So, for a '?', each choice contributes to the DP. So, for the '?', the number of choices is 3, and each choice is processed separately.

So, for j=1, the previous state is mask_prev=0b100, k_prev=0.

For choice A:

new_mask = 0b000.

sum_prev = mask_count[j=0][0b000] + mask_count[j=0][0b111] = 1 + 0 = 1.

new_k = 0 + 1 = 1.

So, dp[2][0b000][1] += 1 * 1 (since this choice contributes 1 way).

For choice B:

delta is 0b010. new_mask = 0b100 ^ 0b010 = 0b110.

sum_prev = mask_count[j=0][0b110] + mask_count[j=0][0b001] = 0 + 0 = 0.

new_k = 0 + 0 = 0.

So, dp[2][0b110][0] += 1 * 1.

For choice C:

delta is 0b001. new_mask = 0b100 ^ 0b001 = 0b101.

sum_prev = mask_count[j=0][0b101] + mask_count[j=0][0b010] = 0 + 0 = 0.

new_k = 0 + 0 = 0.

So, dp[2][0b101][0] += 1 * 1.

So, after j=1 (processing the second character), the DP for j=2 has:

mask 0b000, k=1: 1 way.

mask 0b110, k=0: 1 way.

mask 0b101, k=0: 1 way.

Now, processing j=2 (third character, which is 'A').

For each of the three states in j=2:

First state: mask_prev=0b000, k_prev=1.

Character is 'A', so delta is 0b100. new_mask = 0b000 ^ 0b100 = 0b100.

sum_prev is mask_count[j=2][0b100] + mask_count[j=2][0b011].

mask_count[j=2] is computed as sum over all k_prev for each mask:

mask 0b000: 1 way.

mask 0b110: 1 way.

mask 0b101: 1 way.

So, mask_count[0b100] = 0.

mask_count[0b011] = 0.

sum_prev = 0 + 0 = 0.

new_k = 1 + 0 = 1.

So, dp[3][0b100][1] += 1 * 1.

Second state: mask_prev=0b110, k_prev=0.

Character is 'A', delta 0b100. new_mask = 0b110 ^ 0b100 = 0b010.

sum_prev = mask_count[j=2][0b010] + mask_count[j=2][0b101] = 0 + 1 = 1.

new_k = 0 + 1 = 1.

So, dp[3][0b010][1] += 1 * 1.

Third state: mask_prev=0b101, k_prev=0.

Character is 'A', delta 0b100. new_mask = 0b101 ^ 0b100 = 0b001.

sum_prev = mask_count[j=2][0b001] + mask_count[j=2][0b110] = 0 + 1 = 1.

new_k = 0 + 1 = 1.

So, dp[3][0b001][1] += 1 * 1.

So, after j=2, the DP for j=3 has:

mask 0b100, k=1: 1.

mask 0b010, k=1: 1.

mask 0b001, k=1: 1.

Now, processing j=3 (fourth character, which is 'B').

For each state in j=3:

First state: mask_prev=0b100, k_prev=1.

Character is 'B', delta 0b010. new_mask = 0b100 ^ 0b010 = 0b110.

sum_prev = mask_count[j=3][0b110] + mask_count[j=3][0b001].

mask_count[j=3] is:

mask 0b100: 1.

mask 0b010: 1.

mask 0b001: 1.

So, mask_count[0b110] = 0, mask_count[0b001] = 1.

sum_prev = 0 + 1 = 1.

new_k = 1 + 1 = 2.

So, dp[4][0b110][2] += 1 * 1.

Second state: mask_prev=0b010, k_prev=1.

Character is 'B', delta 0b010. new_mask = 0b010 ^ 0b010 = 0b000.

sum_prev = mask_count[j=3][0b000] + mask_count[j=3][0b111] = 0 + 0 = 0.

new_k = 1 + 0 = 1.

So, dp[4][0b000][1] += 1 * 1.

Third state: mask_prev=0b001, k_prev=1.

Character is 'B', delta 0b010. new_mask = 0b001 ^ 0b010 = 0b011.

sum_prev = mask_count[j=3][0b011] + mask_count[j=3][0b100] = 0 + 1 = 1.

new_k = 1 + 1 = 2.

So, dp[4][0b011][2] += 1 * 1.

So, after processing j=3, the DP for j=4 has:

mask 0b110, k=2: 1.

mask 0b000, k=1: 1.

mask 0b011, k=2: 1.

The sum of all dp[4][mask][k] where k >= 2 is 1 + 1 = 2.

But wait, the sample output is 1. What's wrong here?

Ah, because this approach counts all replacement patterns, but in the sample input 1, only one replacement pattern (AAAB) has >= 2 good substrings. But according to the DP, there are two ways that have k >= 2.

Wait, this suggests a mistake in the approach.

Wait, let's re-examine the sample input 1.

The three possible replacements are:

1. AAAB: good substrings are AA (positions 1-2), AA (positions 2-3), and possibly others?

Wait, in the sample explanation, AAAB has two good substrings: the two AA's. Let's check:

For AAAB, the substrings are:

- A (length 1): counts are 1A, 0B, 0C. All even or odd? 1 is odd, 0 even. So no.

- AA (positions 1-2): counts 2A, 0B, 0C. All even. Good.

- AAA (positions 1-3): 3A, 0B, 0C. 3 is odd, 0 even. Not all even or all odd. So not good.

- AAAB (positions 1-4): 3A, 1B, 0C. 3 and 1 are odd, 0 even. Not all even or all odd. Not good.

- A (position 2): 1A. Not good.

- AB (positions 2-3): 1A, 1B. 1 and 1, but C is 0. So not all even or all odd. Not good.

- B (position 3): 1B. Not good.

- A (position 4): 1A. Not good.

So, only the two AA's are good. So the total is 2.

In the DP, the replacement pattern AAAB would be counted as one way, and the DP's calculation for that way would have k=2.

But according to the DP's calculation, there are two ways that result in k >= 2. What are those ways?

Ah, perhaps the DP is considering other replacement patterns. For example, when the '?' is replaced with B or C, but the DP's calculation for those patterns may have k >= 2.

But according to the sample input 1, those other patterns have k=1.

So, why does the DP's calculation show two ways with k >= 2?

Let's see:

In the DP calculation, after processing all four characters, the states with k >= 2 are:

- mask 0b110, k=2: 1 way.

- mask 0b011, k=2: 1 way.

What are these ways?

The first way (mask 0b110, k=2) corresponds to the replacement pattern where the '?' was replaced with A, leading to AAAB. This has two good substrings.

The second way (mask 0b011, k=2) corresponds to a replacement pattern where the '?' was replaced with C, leading to ACAB. But according to the sample explanation, ACAB has only one good substring. So why does the DP count it as having k=2?

This suggests a mistake in the approach.

Ah, here's the problem: the DP is counting all possible good substrings, including those that are not accounted for in the sample explanation.

Wait, in the sample input 1, the replacement pattern ACAB has the substring CAB (positions 3-5?), but wait, the original string is four characters long. So positions are 1-based.

Original string after replacement is ACAB (length 4).

Substrings:

- A (1-1): 1A. Not good.

- AC (1-2
