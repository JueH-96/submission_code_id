            Checks if it's possible to choose n integers c_i from intervals
            [start[i], start[i] + d] such that the minimum absolute difference
            between any two chosen integers is at least s.

            This is checked using a greedy approach on the intervals sorted by start points.
            Let the sorted intervals be [s'_j, e'_j] for j=0 to n-1.
            We try to determine if there exists a sequence y_0, y_1, ..., y_{n-1}
            such that y_j is chosen from interval [s'_j, e'_j] and y_j >= y_{j-1} + s
            for j >= 1.

            We find the smallest possible value for y_j satisfying these conditions.
            y_j = max(s'_j, y_{j-1} + s).
            We need to check if this value y_j is achievable within the interval [s'_j, e'_j],
            i.e., if y_j <= e'_j.

            We need an initial value for y_{-1} to compute required_y for j=0.
            Let y_prev represent y_{j-1}.
            For the first element y_0, required_y = y_prev + s.
            We want y_0 = max(s'_0, y_prev + s).
            To make y_0 as small as possible (ideally s'_0), we need y_prev + s <= s'_0.
            A safe small initial value for y_prev ensures this inequality holds.
            start[i] >= 0. Max possible score is around 2e9.
            y_prev needs to be less than min(start) - max_s.
            min(start) >= 0. max_s can be 2e9.
            y_prev < 0 - 2e9 = -2e9.
            Using -3 * 10**9 is a safe sufficiently small integer.
