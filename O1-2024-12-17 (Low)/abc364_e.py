    # We will use a DP approach where:
    #   dp[c][s] = the minimum total saltiness achievable using exactly c dishes
    #              with total sweetness = s.
    # Dimensions:
    #   c ranges from 0 to N (inclusive).
    #   s ranges from 0 to X (inclusive).
    #
    # Algorithm sketch:
    #  1) Initialize dp with "infinity" saltiness.
    #  2) dp[0][0] = 0 (0 dishes â†’ sweetness=0, saltiness=0).
    #  3) For each dish (a, b), update dp in descending order of c and s:
    #       for c from current maximum possible down to 0:
    #         for s from X-a down to 0:
    #           if dp[c][s] != inf:
    #              dp[c+1][s+a] = min(dp[c+1][s+a], dp[c][s] + b)
    #
    #  4) After processing all dishes, find the maximum c such that
    #     there exists an s for which dp[c][s] <= Y.
    #
    # Complexity:
    #   We do N updates; for each dish we iterate c up to N and s up to X.
    #   So O(N^2 * X) = 80 * 80 * 10,000 = 64e6 in the worst case, which is large.
    #   In a fast language it can be borderline feasible. In Python, we must
    #   implement it carefully to pass. We'll try to keep it as optimized as 
    #   reasonably possible in Python.
    #
    #   (If this were a lower-level language, we could optimize it further. 
    #    But we'll attempt to be efficient in Python too.)
