        """
        We want the number of ways to transform s into t in exactly k operations,
        where each operation "cuts off" a nonempty proper suffix of s and puts it
        in front. Equivalently, if we think of s as a 'rotating offset' around a
        circle of length n, each operation increases that offset by l (1 <= l < n)
        modulo n. We want the offset after k steps to align so that the rotated s
        equals t.

        Key steps:
          1) Find all offsets d in [0..n-1] for which rotating s by d yields t.
             We'll call the set of these offsets A. If no such offset exists, answer is 0.
          2) Let M = 10^9+7. The number of ways to go from offset 0 to offset j in exactly
             k steps (with each step adding a nonzero mod-n amount) is given by (M^k e_0)_j,
             where M is the nÃ—n matrix of all 1's minus identity (so from i you can go to
             any j != i).
             Using eigen-decomposition, one can derive that:
               w_0 = ( (n-1)^k + (-1)^k*(n-1) ) / n   (for offset 0)
               w_j = ( (n-1)^k - (-1)^k ) / n         (for offset j != 0)
          3) Sum these values w_j over j in the set A, under modulo 10^9+7.

        Explanation of formula for M^k e_0:
          - Matrix of all ones J has eigenvalues {n, 0, 0, ..., 0}.
          - Thus (J - I) has eigenvalues {n-1, -1, -1, ..., -1}.
          - One can show in closed form what the (0,j) entries of (J - I)^k are.
