        #   "Among indices j where nums1[j] >= x and nums2[j] >= y,
        #    find the maximum of nums1[j] + nums2[j], or -1 if none."
        #
        # Because both n and len(queries) can each be up to 1e5, we need an O((n+Q) log(n+Q)) solution.
        # We'll use an "offline" approach:
        #
        # Steps:
        # 1) Pair up each index i into (nums1[i], nums2[i]) and compute sum[i] = nums1[i] + nums2[i].
        # 2) Sort these pairs in descending order by nums1, and if tied, descending by nums2.
        # 3) Each query (x, y) will also be processed in descending order of x.
        # 4) We need to efficiently find the maximum sum among pairs whose nums2 >= y.
        #    We'll use a Fenwick tree (BIT) or segment tree over nums2. Because nums2 can be up to 1e9,
        #    we must do coordinate compression on all possible y-values (both from nums2 and the queries).
        # 5) As we move through sorted queries by descending x, we will "activate" all pairs with nums1 >= x.
        #    For each activated pair, we update the Fenwick tree with the pair's nums2 coordinate â†’ sum.
        # 6) Then to answer the query, we want the maximum sum for all indices coords >= query's y-coordinate.
        #    We'll do a Fenwick tree that can query a suffix maximum. This can be done by storing
        #    reversed indices in the Fenwick tree. 
        #
        # Implementation details below.

        n = len(nums1)

        # 1) Build array of points and their sums
        points = [(nums1[i], nums2[i]) for i in range(n)]
        # 2) Sort points by nums1 descending, tie-break by nums2 descending
        points.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]), reverse=True)
