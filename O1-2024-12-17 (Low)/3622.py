        We want to find the largest subset of nums that can be turned into the same value
        using at most numOperations single-use modifications, where each chosen element can
        be shifted by up to Â±k.

        Key insight:
        - If we sort nums, then any subset we make identical must lie (after shifting) in
          some interval of length <= 2k. That is, for a chosen target X in that interval,
          each element in the subset must satisfy |nums[i] - X| <= k.
        - This is equivalent to saying, in sorted order, the difference between the minimum
          and maximum in the chosen window is at most 2k (to have a non-empty intersection
          of [nums[i]-k, nums[i]+k]).
        - Even if the intersection condition is satisfied, we still need to ensure we do
          not exceed numOperations distinct changes to make them all one value. If in a
          chosen window of length w, the most frequent element appears freq times, we need
          at most w - freq changes to unify the window to that element. If w - freq <=
          numOperations, the whole window can be made identical.
        
        We'll use a two-pointer (sliding window) approach over the sorted array:
        1. Sort nums -> arr.
        2. Use two pointers l and r to keep track of a valid window where arr[r] - arr[l] <= 2k.
        3. Maintain a frequency map of elements in the current window, plus a "frequency of
           frequencies" map to track the maximum frequency in O(1) time.
        4. Expand r, and while the window is invalid (arr[r] - arr[l] > 2k), move l up.
        5. At each valid window, if (window_size - current_max_freq) <= numOperations,
           we can unify that window. Track the best (max) window size.

        Time Complexity: O(n), because each element is added and removed from the window
        at most once, and we maintain the maximum frequency in O(1) for each update.
