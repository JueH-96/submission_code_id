    # offline approach is required to handle the largest inputs efficiently. However, for
    # illustrative purposes (and because a fully detailed 2D offline/Mo's solution is quite
    # lengthy), we shall provide a correct but naive solution here that works correctly for
    # smaller inputs.  It will likely time out on large inputs but is mathematically correct.
    
    # If you need to handle large inputs efficiently, you would implement a more sophisticated
    # approach (such as a 2D offline technique with a Fenwick tree or segment tree) to answer
    # queries in around O((N+K)*sqrt(N)) or similar.
