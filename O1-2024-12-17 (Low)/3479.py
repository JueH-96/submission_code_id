        We want the number of substrings whose count of '1's is >= (count of '0's)^2.
        Let:
           z = number of zeros in a substring
           o = number of ones in a substring
           L = length of that substring = z + o
        The condition is: o >= z^2  =>  (L - z) >= z^2  =>  L >= z^2 + z  =>  L >= z * (z + 1).

        Observing that s can be up to length 40,000:
        - A naive O(n^2) approach is too large (could be ~1.6 billion checks).
        - Notice if z > 200, then z^2 = 40,000+ which cannot be satisfied by any
          substring of length â‰¤ 40,000. Hence effectively z <= 200 in any valid substring.

        We can use prefix sums of zeros:
          prefixZeros[i] = number of zeros in s[:i]  (i.e. up to but not including index i).
        Then the substring s[l..r] has z = prefixZeros[r+1] - prefixZeros[l].

        We'll iterate r from 0..(n-1). Let c = prefixZeros[r+1].
        Then the number of zeros in s[l..r] is c - prefixZeros[l].
        If that equals z, we check if (r - l + 1) >= z*(z+1). Rearranging,
           l <= r + 1 - (z*(z+1)).
        We only need to check z up to min(c, 200), because z cannot exceed c
        (the total zeros up to r).

        We keep, for each possible zero-count "val", a sorted list of indices "i"
        where prefixZeros[i] == val. At step r, to find how many l's produce z zeros
        in s[l..r], we look for all l in occur[c - z], with l <= (r+1) - z*(z+1).
        We'll do a binary search to count how many such l's exist.

        Complexity:
         - We do n iterations for r.
         - For each r, we consider up to 201 values of z.
         - Each check uses a binary search O(log(n)).
         - Total ~ O(n * 201 * log(n)) which is around 40,000 * 201 * log(40,000) ~
           on the order of 100 million ops. In optimized Python this can be borderline,
           but typically can be done with efficient code.

        We'll implement this approach below.
