        We have three children starting from corners:
          • Child 1 at (0,0) who can move (i+1,j+1) (diagonal only to reach bottom-right in exactly n-1 steps)
          • Child 2 at (0,n-1) who in each step goes down one row (i+1) and can shift column by -1, 0, or +1
          • Child 3 at (n-1,0) who in each step goes right one column (j+1) and can shift row by -1, 0, or +1
        
        Child 1's path is actually forced to be the main diagonal (0,0)->(1,1)->...->(n-1,n-1),
        because in exactly (n-1) moves it must gain (n-1) in both row and column. The only way
        to do that (given a single move can raise i+j by either 1 or 2) is to always move diagonally.
        
        Therefore, we can:
          1) Collect and remove (set to zero) all fruits on the main diagonal for Child 1.
          2) Solve a "two-traveler" problem for Child 2 and Child 3 on the modified grid (which now has 0 on the main diagonal).
             - Child 2 starts at (0,n-1) and ends at (n-1,n-1), row increasing each step, column shifting in {−1,0,+1}.
             - Child 3 starts at (n-1,0) and ends at (n-1,n-1), column increasing each step, row shifting in {−1,0,+1}.
             - They each take exactly n-1 steps. At "time" t (0-based), Child 2 is at (t, c2), Child 3 is at (r3, t).
             - We want to maximize the sum of distinct fruits visited by these two.  If they land on the same cell at step t,
               we only collect that cell's fruit once.
        
        We can do a DP over t = 0..(n-1), and for each t keep a 2D array dp[c2][r3], meaning:
            "the maximum sum we can achieve if at time t:
               Child 2 is at (t, c2)
               Child 3 is at (r3, t)
             after t moves each."
        
        Transitions come from dp[prev_c2][prev_r3] at time t-1, where Child 2 could have been at (t-1, prev_c2) and Child 3 at (prev_r3, t-1).
        The moves allowed for Child 2 from column prev_c2 to c2 are in {−1,0,+1}, likewise for Child 3 from row prev_r3 to r3 in {−1,0,+1},
        all while staying in-bounds [0..n-1].
        
        Then at time t, the newly visited squares are (t, c2) and (r3, t). We sum up fruits[t][c2] + fruits[r3][t] if they are different squares,
        or just one copy if they coincide. We pick the max over all valid transitions.
        
        After we finish t = n-1, dp[n-1][n-1] will hold the maximum fruits that Child 2 and Child 3 together can collect on the modified grid.
        We add back the sum of the main diagonal fruits that Child 1 collected, and return the total.
        
        Complexity:
          • For each t in 0..n-1, we have an n×n dp array. Each cell has up to 9 predecessors. That is O(n^3) in time.
          • n ≤ 1000 is quite large for an O(n^3) in Python, but can often pass with efficient implementation and pruning. 
            (In a lower-level language this is more comfortably within typical time limits.)
        
        We'll implement it carefully in Python. In practice, one might need further optimizations or pruning, 
        but we'll present the core DP idea here as a correct general solution.
