Explanation of the key recurrence:

1) Let count_0[c], count_1[c] be how many subarrays ending exactly at position c have final aggregator 0 or 1.  
2) A subarray that ends at c either is extended from one that ended at c−1 or it is a brand-new single-element subarray (c..c).  
3) If the current bit A[c] is '0', then:  
   • Any subarray that ended at c−1 with aggregator=0 flips to aggregator=1 here (since 0 NAND anything = 1).  
   • Any subarray that ended at c−1 with aggregator=1 remains aggregator=1 here (since 1 NAND 0 = 1).  
   • The new (c..c) subarray has aggregator=0 if A[c]=0.  
   ⇒ count_0[c] = 1,  count_1[c] = (c−1).  
4) If the current bit A[c] is '1', then:  
   • Any subarray that ended at c−1 with aggregator=1 flips to aggregator=0 (since 1 NAND 1 = 0).  
   • Any subarray that ended at c−1 with aggregator=0 flips to aggregator=1 (since 0 NAND 1 = 1).  
   • The new (c..c) single-element subarray has aggregator=1 if A[c]=1.  
   ⇒ count_0[c] = count_1[c−1],  count_1[c] = count_0[c−1] + 1.  

Summing count_1[c] over c=1..N directly gives the total  
Σ(over all subarrays) of final aggregator values = Σ f(i,j).
