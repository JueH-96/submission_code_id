    def canMakePalindromeQueries(self, s: str, queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[bool]:
        """
        We have an even-length string s (length = n).  We will receive queries of the form [a,b,c,d],
        with 0 <= a <= b < n/2 and n/2 <= c <= d < n.  For each query, we are allowed to reorder
        (permute) the characters in s[a..b] (left half) and s[c..d] (right half), and we want to see
        if it is possible to make the entire string s into a palindrome by those re-orderings alone.
        
        Each query is independent (i.e., the string reverts to its original state for the next query).
        
        The approach is:
        
          1) Palindrome pairs: For i in [0..(n/2 - 1)], the character s[i] must match s[n-1-i].
             - If neither s[i] nor s[n-1-i] can be rearranged (i.e. i not in [a..b], n-1-i not in [c..d]),
               then s[i] must already match s[n-1-i], or else it's impossible.
             - If one side is fixed and the other side is flexible, we must "reserve" that fixed character
               from the flexible side's character multiset.
             - If both sides are flexible, there's no immediate restriction for that pair, other
               than eventually the leftover flexible characters in the left must match (as a multiset)
               the leftover flexible characters in the right.
        
          2) We do this efficiently by precomputations:
             - diff[i] = 1 if s[i] != s[n-1-i], else 0, for i in [0..(n/2 - 1)].
               Then prefixDiff array lets us count how many mismatches are in any range in O(1).
             - prefixLeft[c][i]  = how many of character c ('a'..'z') in s[0..i-1] (left half).
             - prefixRight[c][i] = how many of character c in s[n/2..n/2 + i - 1] (right half).
               (Hence prefixRight[c][i] is over the right half but indexed 0-based.)
             - We also build rarr[i] = s[n-1 - i] for i in [0..(n/2 - 1)], i.e. the "reversed right side."
               Then prefixRrev[c][i] = how many of character c in rarr[0..i-1].
               This allows us to quickly count how many times each character appears in
               { s[n-1 - i] | i in some subset of [0..n/2 - 1] } in O(1) by a prefix difference.
        
          3) Steps to answer a query (a,b,c,d):
             - Let Lflex = [a..b] (the flexible range in the left half), Rflex = [c..d] (the flexible
               range in the right half).  Then Lfixed = [0..(n/2 - 1)] \ Lflex,  Rfixed = [n/2..n-1] \ Rflex.
            
             A) Check "unfixable" mismatches:
                We only fail if there's a mismatch in positions i where BOTH i not in Lflex
                and (n-1-i) not in Rflex.  In other words, that pair is fully fixed, so s[i] must
                already match s[n-1-i].  We count how many such mismatches exist and if > 0 => False.
                
                Implementation:
                  -- define diff[i] = 1 if s[i] != s[n-1-i] else 0
                  -- we want to exclude i in [a..b] and also exclude i in the set { i | n-1-i in [c..d] }
                     which is i in [n-1-d..n-1-c].
                  -- let mismatchAll = total mismatches in [0..n/2 -1].
                     let mismatchExclLeft  = mismatches in [a..b].
                     let mismatchExclRight = mismatches in [n-1-d..n-1-c] (intersection with [0..n/2 -1]).
                     use inclusion-exclusion for the intersection of those intervals.
                  -- if the number of mismatches that remain after exclusions > 0 => False.

             B) Reserve characters from the flexible side for "fixed vs flexible" pairs:
                - For i in [0..n/2 -1]:
                    * If i is fixed (not in Lflex) and (n-1-i) is flexible => we must place s[i] on the right side.
                      So we "need" one occurrence of s[i] in Rflex.
                    * If i is flexible and (n-1-i) is fixed => we must place s[n-1-i] on the left side.
                      So we "need" one occurrence of s[n-1-i] in Lflex.
                We gather how many times each letter is needed on the right side (neededRight) and how many
                are needed on the left side (neededLeft).
                
                We'll do this counting in O(1) by prefix sums, but we must carefully define intervals:
                  let S1 = { i | i in Lfixed (not in [a..b]) and (n-1-i) in Rflex ([c..d]) }.
                         = intersection( [0..n/2 -1] \ [a..b], [n-1-d..n-1-c] )
                         i.e. i must lie in that intersection.
                  We find how many times each letter s[i] appears in S1 => neededRight[ letter s[i] ].
                  We'll do that by creating intervals and querying prefix sums for left half.
                
                  let S2 = { i | i in Lflex ([a..b]) and (n-1-i) in Rfixed (not in [c..d]) }.
                         = intersection( [a..b], [0..n/2 -1] \ [n-1-d..n-1-c] ).
                  But the letter needed on the left is s[n-1-i].  So we will count the frequency of rarr[i]
                  in that set of i.  Because rarr[i] = s[n-1 - i].  We can again break that set into intervals
                  and use prefix sums of rarr to find how many times each letter occurs.
                
                - Then we compare neededRight vs freqRflex to ensure Rflex can supply those needed chars.
                  Similarly compare neededLeft vs freqLflex to ensure Lflex can supply those needed chars.
                  If not, => False.  Otherwise we subtract from freqRflex/freqLflex.
                
             C) Finally, whatever is leftover in Lflex must match exactly (as a frequency multiset)
                what is leftover in Rflex, or else we cannot form a palindrome on the flexible pairs
                that are (flex, flex).  So after subtracting the reserved counts, we check if
                freqLflex == freqRflex.  If yes => True, else => False.

          Because n and the number of queries can each be up to 10^5, we must answer each query in O(1..log n)
          or O(1..26) time.  By using prefix sums (for mismatches, for each letter in the left half,
          for each letter in the right half, and for rarr), we can achieve an O(26) time per query, which is
          feasible if implemented efficiently.
