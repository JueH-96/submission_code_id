        We have n distinct integers in nums and a positive integer threshold.
        Build a graph of n nodes (each node corresponds to one element in nums),
        and connect two nodes i, j by an undirected edge if LCM(nums[i], nums[j]) <= threshold.
        We must return the number of connected components of this graph.
        
        Key observations / approach:
        1) If a number x in nums is strictly greater than threshold, then for any other number y >= 1,
           LCM(x, y) >= x > threshold. So that node is isolated (no edges to anything else).
           Hence, all numbers > threshold are each alone in their own connected component.

        2) Only the numbers <= threshold can possibly have edges among themselves. We must find
           how those numbers (call that set S1) connect under the condition LCM(a, b) <= threshold.

        3) A classical way (used in similar problems) to avoid O(n^2) checks is:
           - Focus on integers k = 1..threshold.
           - Among the multiples of k that appear in S1 (i.e., k, 2k, 3k, ... <= threshold),
             we can check consecutive multiples to see if they are connected.
           - In particular, consider k*i and k*(i+1). If both appear in S1 and 
             LCM(k*i, k*(i+1)) <= threshold, then we union them in a DSU (disjoint-set / union-find).

        4) Why consecutive multiples?
           - Let a = k*i, b = k*(i+1). Then gcd(a, b) >= k, and
             LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b).
             Because they differ by k, gcd(a, b) = k (since i and i+1 are coprime),
             so LCM(a, b) = (k*i) * (k*(i+1)) / k = k * i * (i+1).
           - We only union them if k*i*(i+1) <= threshold.

        5) Implementation details:
           - Partition nums into S2 = { x | x>threshold }, which are all isolated.
           - S1 = { x | x<=threshold }.
           - Store a dictionary val_to_idx so we know which index in nums each S1-value corresponds to.
           - Initialize a union-find (DSU) data structure for the S1 portion.
           - For each k = 1..threshold:
               - Walk multiples m = k, 2k, 3k, ... up to <= threshold.
               - Keep track of the last multiple of k found in S1, call it prev.
               - When we find a new multiple cur in S1, if prev is not None and
                 k * ( (prev//k) ) * ( (prev//k) + 1 ) <= threshold
                 (where (prev//k) and (cur//k) should be consecutive integers),
                 then union the DSU sets of val_to_idx[prev] and val_to_idx[cur].
                 - Then update prev = cur.
           - Count how many distinct DSU parents are in S1.
           - Add len(S2) to that DSU count to get the final result.

        6) Complexity:
           - We iterate k = 1..threshold. For each k, we go through multiples k, 2k, 3k, ...
             The total number of steps is about threshold * (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/threshold)
             ~ threshold * log(threshold). For threshold up to 2e5, this is on the order of a couple
             million operations, which can be done in optimized Python. We do union-find (amortized ~ Î±(n))
             which is very small. This should be acceptable if implemented carefully.

        Let's implement the described approach.
