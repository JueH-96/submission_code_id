        """
        We are given an integer array nums of length n up to 2000, and q queries up to 100,000.
        Each query is [l, r]. For the subarray nums[l..r], we must find the maximum "XOR score"
        over all of its contiguous sub-subarrays.

        The "XOR score" of an array a of length k is obtained by repeatedly applying:
           a[i] = a[i] XOR a[i+1]  (for i in [0..k-2] simultaneously)
        then removing the last element, until only one element remains.

        It is a known fact (which can be verified by small examples or by using
        repeated-differences in mod 2) that the final 1-element result of that process
        for a subarray a[i..i+k-1] can be precomputed via the so-called "k-1-th forward difference":

            diff[k-1][i]  (where diff[0][i] = nums[i],
             and diff[row][i] = diff[row-1][i] XOR diff[row-1][i+1])

        so the "XOR score" of nums[i..i+k-1] == diff[k-1][i].

        We want, for each query [l, r], the maximum possible diff[k-1][i] over
        all subarray lengths k = 1..(r-l+1) and subarray starts i in [l..r-k+1].

        Approach:
        1) Precompute the 2D table diff[row][i], where row = 0..(n-1), i = 0..(n-row-1).
           - diff[0][i] = nums[i]
           - diff[row][i] = diff[row-1][i] XOR diff[row-1][i+1]
           This takes O(n^2) time.
        2) For each row (0..n-1), build a 1D Range-Max-Query (RMQ) structure (sparse table)
           over diff[row].  The length of diff[row] is n-row.
           Building each row's sparse table is O((n-row) * log(n-row)) overall, so total ~ O(n^2 log n).
        3) To answer a query [l, r], let length_range = r - l.  We must consider all row in [0..length_range].
           - row corresponds to subarray-length = row+1
           - permissible i in the range [l..(r - row)]
           We do one RMQ query on diff[row] over [l..(r-row)] to get the maximum, repeated for each row.
           That is O(length_range+1) RMQ calls in the worst case.

        Although this is O(n) per query and can be up to 2e8 operations for q=1e5 and n=2000,
        in a lower-level language (C++), carefully optimized, it can be made to pass. In Python,
        it is borderline and typically would require fast IO or further optimization (or PyPy).
        However, this is the straightforward method given the constraints.

        We'll implement exactly this solution.
