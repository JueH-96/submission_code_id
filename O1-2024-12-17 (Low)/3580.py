# Explanation:
# 1) We iterate over all possible starting indices (0..n-m).
# 2) For each window of length len(pattern), we count the mismatches against 'pattern'.
# 3) If we get more than one mismatch, we break early to avoid extra checks.
#    This makes it faster in practice when mismatches appear early.
# 4) If mismatch_count <= 1, we answer with that start index.
# 5) If we finish looping without finding a suitable window, return -1.
# 
# This solution is correct and should pass typical test cases. 
# For extremely large inputs (e.g., |s|=10^5, |pattern|=10^5), 
# the worst-case O(n*m) = 10^10 might be high. 
# In practice, further optimization (e.g. sliding window mismatch tracking) 
# would be needed for strict time constraints. 
#
# Follow-up (k consecutive changes): We would need a sliding window technique 
# tracking consecutive differences to handle up to k consecutive mismatches more efficiently.
