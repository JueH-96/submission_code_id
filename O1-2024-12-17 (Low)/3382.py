        """
        We want to count the number of subarrays of nums where:
          1) The first and last elements of the subarray are the same,
          2) That element is also the maximum in the subarray.

        Key observation:
          If a subarray has its maximum element = x, and both ends are x,
          then all elements in the subarray are <= x, and the subarray
          starts and ends with x.

        One way to count these efficiently is to process the array in
        ascending order of values and use a Disjoint Set Union (DSU)
        structure to keep track of "active" indices (those whose value
        has been encountered/processed). Indices become active when
        we process their value. Once active, they can be union-ed with
        adjacent active indices if those adjacent indices have values
        <= the current value (which is guaranteed by processing in
        ascending order).

        For each value group v:
          - We activate the indices that have value = v (make them
            singletons in the DSU).
            Each such index immediately contributes 1 new subarray
            (the single-element subarray).
          - We then union each newly activated index with its active
            neighbor(s). Merging two components that contain c1 and c2
            active indices of value v respectively will form c1*c2 new
            subarrays (each choice of one of the c1 indices with one
            of the c2 indices forms a new [start, end] of the same
            value v and no bigger value in between).

        Complexity:
          - We gather all indices by their values, sort these values
            (O(n log n) in the worst case).
          - For each index, we do up to two union operations in DSU
            (amortized Î±(n) per operation, nearly O(1)*).
          - Hence total is O(n log n) dominated by sorting.

        This correctly counts all subarrays meeting the stated condition.
