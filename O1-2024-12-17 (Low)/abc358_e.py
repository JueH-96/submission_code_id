    # We only need to handle sequence lengths up to K (â‰¤ 1000).
    # We will use a dynamic programming approach where:
    # dp[i][j] = number of distinct strings of length j using only the
    # first i letters (A..(A+i-1)) such that the count of each letter
    # does not exceed its limit.
    # Finally, dp[26][1] + dp[26][2] + ... + dp[26][K] gives the answer.

    # However, storing dp in 2D would be large but we only need dp for the previous i
    # at each step. So we can do a 1D rolling array:
    # dp[j] after processing i-th letter.

    # Recurrence:
    # dp_new[j] = sum_{k=0..min(C_i, j)} [ comb(j, k) * dp_old[j-k] ]
    # Explanation:
    #  - We choose how many times (k) we use the i-th letter in a length-j string
    #  - We can place those k occurrences among the j positions in comb(j,k) ways
    #  - The remaining j-k positions are filled by strings counted in dp_old[j-k]
    #    (which uses i-1 letters with constraints)

                # So we do the k=0 term manually (it is comb(length,0)*dp[length] = dp[length]).

        # new_dp[j] += sum_{k=0..min(limit,j)} comb(j, k)*dp_old[j-k].
        # We'll do exactly that approach for each j.

            #
