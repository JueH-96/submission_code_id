        We want the number of length-n arrays with elements in [1, m] such that
        exactly k adjacent pairs are equal.

        A well-known combinatorial argument shows that the number of such arrays is:
            C(n-1, k) * m * (m-1)^(n-1-k)
        modulo 1e9+7.

        Explanation:
        - Let "runs" be blocks of consecutive identical elements in the array.
          If an array has r runs, then there are (r-1) positions where adjacent
          elements differ and thus (n-1) - (r-1) = n-r positions where adjacent
          elements are equal.
        - To have exactly k equal-adjacent pairs, we need k = (n-r).
          So r = n - k.
        - The ways to pick which indices define the r runs (all runs have at least
          one element) is C(n-1, r-1). This partitions the n elements into r runs.
        - For each run, we pick values from [1, m] such that adjacent runs use
          different values. The first run can use any of m possibilities, and each
          of the remaining (r-1) runs can use any of (m-1) possibilities (since it
          must differ from the previous run), giving m * (m-1)^(r-1).
        - Substituting r = n - k, the final formula becomes:
            C(n-1, k) * m * (m-1)^(n-1-k).

        We'll implement this with precomputed factorials and modular inverses
        to efficiently compute C(n-1, k) under modulo 1e9+7.
