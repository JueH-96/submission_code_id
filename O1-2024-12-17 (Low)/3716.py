    def longestSubsequence(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        We want the longest subsequence whose consecutive absolute differences
        form a non-increasing sequence. Equivalently, if d_i is the absolute
        difference between consecutive elements in the subsequence, we require:
           d_1 >= d_2 >= d_3 >= ...

        We'll use a dynamic programming approach. Let dp[i][d] be the length of 
        the longest valid subsequence ending at index i with the last absolute 
        difference = d. We'll also maintain prefix_dp[i][d], which is the maximum 
        dp[i][x] among all x >= d.  This lets us quickly compute transitions for 
        non-increasing differences.

        Algorithm (O(n^2) time, which can work for n <= 10^4 with careful implementation):
          1) Initialize dp[i][d] = 1 for all i, d, because by default we can 
             consider (nums[i]) as a 1-length subsequence (though the "difference"
             is only meaningful once we have two or more elements).
          2) For i in [0..n-1]:
               For j in [0..i-1]:
                 d = abs(nums[i] - nums[j])
                 # We can append nums[i] to any subsequence ending at j 
                 # whose last difference â‰¥ d
                 best_len = prefix_dp[j][d] + 1
                 dp[i][d] = max(dp[i][d], best_len)
          3) After filling dp[i], build prefix_dp[i] in descending order of d:
               prefix_dp[i][299] = dp[i][299]
               for d in [298..0]:
                 prefix_dp[i][d] = max(dp[i][d], prefix_dp[i][d+1])
          4) Track the global maximum dp[i][d] for answer.
