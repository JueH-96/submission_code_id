        We want to count the number of positive integers x < n (where n is given in binary by s)
        for which repeatedly replacing x by the count of its set bits (at most k times) results in 1.
        
        Approach:
        1. Let n be the integer represented by the binary string s of length L (1 <= L <= 800).
        2. Define chainLenPopcount(p) to be the minimum t such that applying popcount t times on
           a number whose bit-count is p yields 1. For p=1, chainLenPopcount(1)=0 (already 1). For p>1,
           chainLenPopcount(p) = 1 + chainLenPopcount(popcount(p)). For p=0, define it as something
           large so we do not count x=0.
        3. We perform a digit-DP to count how many x < n have a particular popcount x_pop. Then we
           check if chainLenPopcount(x_pop) <= k.
           
           Let bits of n = nbits[0..L-1].
           We define dp[pos][isLess][popcountSoFar] = number of ways to form a binary number of length pos
           with accumulated popcount = popcountSoFar, where isLess indicates whether we are already strictly
           less than the prefix of n or still matching exactly up to this digit.

           Transitions:
             - We can pick the next bit (0 or 1) subject to the limit if isLess=0 (meaning we can't exceed nbits[pos]).
             - If we pick bit b (0 or 1), we go to dp[pos+1][newIsLess][popcountSoFar + b].
               where newIsLess = isLess or (b < nbits[pos]) if isLess=0; if isLess=1 we can pick b up to 1 freely.
        
        4. At the end (pos=L), the count of valid x is the sum of dp[L][1][p] over all p s.t. chainLenPopcount(p) <= k.
           We do not include dp[L][0][p] because that corresponds to x == n, but we need x < n.
        5. The result is returned modulo 1e9+7.
