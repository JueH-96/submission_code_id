    # We will solve this by sorting all cells in ascending order of elevation
    # and using a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) structure.
    # As we increase sea level L from 1..Y, we "activate" all cells whose elevation <= L.
    # Then we union these cells with their neighbors that are already activated.
    # If the connected component of any activated cell touches a boundary,
    # that entire component is considered "sunken" (sea).
    #
    # Key idea: a cell sinks if it is connected (through cells of elevation <= L) to the boundary.
    # We'll keep track of the size of each connected component. If a component is marked "sea,"
    # all its cells are sunk. The number of cells above water = total_cells - number_of_sunk_cells.
    #
    # We'll process the cells in ascending elevation order, keep a pointer into that sorted list.
    # For each L = 1..Y, we union in all cells whose elevation <= L, and if the newly formed
    # component touches any boundary (or merges with a boundary-sunk component), it becomes sea.
    # We accumulate results for each L.
    #
    # Implementation details:
    # 1) Flatten cells into (elev, r, c) and sort by elev.
    # 2) Union-Find with an array to mark whether a root is "sea" and the size of each component.
    # 3) As we activate cells, we union them with already activated neighbors.
    #    If the unioned component touches boundary, mark it as sea. Then we update
    #    the global count of sunk cells accordingly.
    # 4) For each L in 1..Y, store total_cells - sunk_cells in the output.
    #
