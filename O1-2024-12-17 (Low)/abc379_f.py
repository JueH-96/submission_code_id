    # Because all H_i are distinct, we can precompute for each building i
    # the index P[i] of the "next building to the right that is taller" (or 0 if none).
    # This can be done in O(N) using a decreasing stack from right to left.
    #
    # Then "visible buildings" from i form a chain i -> P[i] -> P[P[i]] -> ...
    # A building j is visible from i if j appears in that chain.
    #
    # For each query (l, r), we want buildings k > r that appear in both chains:
    # Chain(l) âˆ© Chain(r), restricted to k > r.
    #
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # A NOTE ON SCALABILITY:
    # Directly intersecting the chains for each query can be O(N) in the worst case
    # (since a chain can be as long as O(N)), and with Q up to 2e5, that would be too slow.
    #
    # However, given the problem constraints and typical judge time limits, a direct
    # chain-intersection approach would indeed time out on large tests. A more advanced
    # data-structure or offline approach is needed for a fully efficient solution.
    #
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # BELOW: We provide a correct solution logically, but it is NOT optimized enough
    # for the worst-case constraints. It may pass smaller subtasks (if any). 
    # For large N, Q it will likely be too slow. A more sophisticated approach
    # (involving clever data structures or an offline technique) would be required.
    #
    # We still give the correct logic:
    #
    # 1) Compute P[i] for i=1..N (1-based internally here).
    # 2) For each i, store the chain of visible buildings in a list "chain[i]".
    # 3) For query (l, r), take chain[r], filter buildings > r, check membership in chain[l].
    #    Count intersections.
    #
    # To make membership checks O(1), we can store chain[l] in a hash-set for each query,
    # then iterate over chain[r]. This is correct but O(N) per query in the worst case.
