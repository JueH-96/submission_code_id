        Calculates the maximum achievable number x.

        An integer x is called achievable if it can become equal to num after 
        applying the following operation no more than t times:
        - Increase or decrease x by 1 (let the change be dx, where dx is +1 or -1).
        - Simultaneously, increase or decrease num by 1 (let the change be dn, where dn is +1 or -1).

        Let x_0 be the initial value of x that we are looking for (the achievable number).
        Let num_0 = num be the given initial value of num.
        Suppose after k operations (where 0 <= k <= t), the values become x_k and num_k.
        The condition for x_0 being achievable is that there exists such a sequence of k operations
        resulting in x_k = num_k.

        The value of x after k operations is x_k = x_0 + sum(dx_i for i=1 to k).
        The value of num after k operations is num_k = num_0 + sum(dn_i for i=1 to k).

        Setting x_k = num_k:
        x_0 + sum(dx_i) = num_0 + sum(dn_i)
        
        Rearranging to solve for x_0:
        x_0 = num_0 + sum(dn_i) - sum(dx_i)
        x_0 = num_0 + sum(dn_i - dx_i for i=1 to k)

        Let's analyze the possible values for the change in the difference (dn_i - dx_i) in a single operation:
        1. If dx_i = +1 and dn_i = +1, then dn_i - dx_i = 1 - 1 = 0.
        2. If dx_i = +1 and dn_i = -1, then dn_i - dx_i = -1 - 1 = -2. (x increases, num decreases)
        3. If dx_i = -1 and dn_i = +1, then dn_i - dx_i = 1 - (-1) = 2. (x decreases, num increases)
        4. If dx_i = -1 and dn_i = -1, then dn_i - dx_i = -1 - (-1) = 0.

        Let p be the number of times operation type 3 (change = +2) is performed.
        Let m be the number of times operation type 2 (change = -2) is performed.
        Let z be the number of times operation type 1 or 4 (change = 0) is performed.
        The total number of operations is k = p + m + z.
        The problem states that the number of operations must be no more than t, so k <= t.

        The sum term can be expressed as:
        sum(dn_i - dx_i for i=1 to k) = p * 2 + m * (-2) + z * 0 = 2*p - 2*m

        Substituting this back into the equation for x_0:
        x_0 = num_0 + 2*p - 2*m
        x_0 = num_0 + 2 * (p - m)

        We want to find the maximum possible value for the achievable number x_0. 
        This means we need to maximize the expression x_0 = num_0 + 2 * (p - m) 
        subject to the constraint that the total number of operations k = p + m + z <= t, 
        and p, m, z are non-negative integers.

        To maximize x_0, we need to maximize the term (p - m).
        To maximize (p - m), we should make p as large as possible and m as small as possible.
        The minimum possible value for m is 0. Let's set m = 0.
        Then the expression we want to maximize is p.
        The constraint becomes p + 0 + z = k <= t, which simplifies to p + z <= t.

        To maximize p subject to p + z <= t (where p >= 0, z >= 0), we should make z as small as possible.
        The minimum possible value for z is 0.
        If we set z = 0, the constraint becomes p <= t.
        The maximum value for p is therefore t.

        This maximum occurs when we choose m = 0 and z = 0. In this scenario, all k operations must be of type 3 (where num increases by 1 and x decreases by 1). The total number of operations is k = p = t. This satisfies the condition k <= t.
        The corresponding values that maximize (p - m) are p = t, m = 0, z = 0.

        The maximum value of (p - m) is t - 0 = t.

        Therefore, the maximum possible achievable value for x_0 is:
        max(x_0) = num_0 + 2 * max(p - m)
        max(x_0) = num_0 + 2 * t

        Since num_0 is the input `num`, the maximum achievable x is num + 2*t.
