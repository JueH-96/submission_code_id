        Counts the number of possible 'copy' arrays that satisfy the given constraints.

        The constraints are:
        1. The difference between consecutive elements in 'copy' must be the same as in 'original'.
           (copy[i] - copy[i - 1]) == (original[i] - original[i - 1]) for 1 <= i <= n - 1.
        2. Each element copy[i] must be within the bounds specified by bounds[i].
           bounds[i][0] <= copy[i] <= bounds[i][1] for 0 <= i <= n - 1.

        Args:
            original: The original array of integers, length n.
            bounds: A 2D list of integers, length n x 2, where bounds[i] = [u_i, v_i]
