    Finds the minimum cost to make strings s1 and s2 equal using two types of operations.
    Operation 1: Flip s1[i] and s1[j] for any i, j. Cost x.
    Operation 2: Flip s1[i] and s1[i+1] for i < n-1. Cost 1. 

    A sequence of Operation 2 from index i to j-1 (i.e., apply Op2 at i, i+1, ..., j-1) 
    results in flipping s1[i] and s1[j], with total cost (j-i) * 1 = j-i.
    The intermediate characters s1[k] for i < k < j are flipped twice, resulting in no net change.
    Therefore, flipping s1[i] and s1[j] (where i < j) can be achieved with a cost of `min(x, j-i)`.

    The problem asks for the minimum cost to make s1 equal to s2. This is equivalent to resolving all
    differences between s1 and s2. Let P be the sorted list of indices where s1[k] != s2[k].
    Each operation effectively resolves two differences (by flipping the bits at two indices). 
    Therefore, the total number of differences, D = len(P), must be even. If D is odd, it's impossible, return -1.
    If D = 0, the strings are already equal, return 0.

    If D is even and positive, we need to pair up all the indices in P. For each pair (Pi, Pj) with i < j, 
    the cost incurred is `min(x, P[j] - P[i])`. We want to find a perfect matching (pairing) of the indices
    in P such that the total cost is minimized.

    This minimum weight perfect matching problem on points on a line can be solved efficiently using 
    dynamic programming on intervals. Let dp[i][j] be the minimum cost to resolve the differences 
    for the sublist of indices P[i...j]. Our goal is to find dp[0][D-1].
    The length of the interval P[i...j] is L = j - i + 1. L must be even.
    
    Base case: For intervals of length L=2 (i.e., j=i+1), we must pair P[i] and P[i+1].
    dp[i][i+1] = min(x, P[i+1] - P[i]).

    Recursive step: For intervals P[i...j] of length L >= 4:
    We consider two possibilities for the optimal solution for P[i...j]:
    1. Pair the outermost indices P[i] and P[j]. The cost is `min(x, P[j] - P[i])` plus the minimum cost
       to resolve the inner interval P[i+1...j-1], which is dp[i+1][j-1].
       Total cost = `min(x, P[j] - P[i]) + dp[i+1][j-1]`.
    2. The interval P[i...j] is split into two smaller, independent intervals P[i...k] and P[k+1...j].
       Both sub-intervals must contain an even number of points. This means the length of P[i...k], 
       which is k-i+1, must be even. This occurs when k = i+1, i+3, ..., j-1.
       The total cost for this option is `dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j]`. We take the minimum over all valid split points k.
    
    dp[i][j] is the minimum cost obtained from option 1 and all possibilities under option 2.
