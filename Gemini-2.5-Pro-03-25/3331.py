class Solution:

    This class provides a solution to the problem of finding the minimum number of operations 
    to make all elements in an array `nums` greater than or equal to a value `k`. 
    An operation consists of removing the smallest element from the array.
    """
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        """
        Calculates the minimum number of operations required such that all elements 
        in the modified list `nums` are greater than or equal to `k`.

        The core idea is that any element initially in `nums` that is less than `k` must eventually 
        be removed through the process of repeatedly removing the smallest element. Conversely, 
        any element removed must be less than `k`, because if the smallest element were already 
        `>= k`, the condition would be met, and the process would stop. 
        Therefore, the number of operations required is exactly the count of elements 
        in the original `nums` array that are strictly less than `k`.

        Args:
            nums: A list of 0-indexed integers. The input array.
            k: An integer threshold. The target minimum value for elements in the array 
               after operations.

        Returns:
            An integer representing the minimum number of operations needed.
        
        Constraints Analysis:
            - 1 <= nums.length <= 50: The array size is small, allowing for O(N) or even O(N log N) solutions.
            - 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9: Element values can be large, but fit within standard integer types.
            - 1 <= k <= 10^9: The threshold `k` can also be large.
            - At least one element nums[i] >= k exists: This guarantees the process terminates and the target state is reachable.
        
        Complexity:
            - Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because we iterate through the list once.
            - Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a single integer variable (`operations_count`) for counting, requiring constant extra space.
